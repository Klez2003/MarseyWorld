Yes. In America, that's a very popular joke.

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:32.315
- Do you have a mother-in-law joke?
- Yes.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.778
I had sexy-time with my mother-in-law.

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:38.655
- A what time?
- Sexy-time.

00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:41.491
I made sexy-time with my mother-in-law.

00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:44.828
- You had sex with your mother-in-law?
- Yes.

00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:47.372
I don't think that Americans
would find that funny.

00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:49.541
- No, it is not a joke.
- Yeah.

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:52.210
We're talking about humor.

00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:54.546
Yes, you asked me about
my mother-in-law.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.257
Do you have a joke about her?

00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:00.009
No, why make a joke on a mother-in-law?

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:05.598
Do you ever laugh on people
with a retardation?

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:09.936
Here in America we try not to make fun of

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.022
or be funny with things
that people don't choose.

00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:18.778
But perhaps you have not seen
someone with a very funny retardation.

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:24.659
My brother, Bilo,
have a very funny retardation.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.415
Mental retardation causes a lot of pain
and hardship for a lot of families.

00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:35.920
Sometime my sister, she show her
vagina to my brother, Bilo, and say,

00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:39.758
"You will never get this!
You will never get this!"

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:43.094
He behind his cage, crazy, crazy.
Everybody laugh.

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.013
She go, "You never get this!"

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:49.601
But one time,
he break cage and he get this.

00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:51.186
And then we all laugh.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.645
High five!

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:55.523
Now...

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:02.781
No, that would not be funny
in America, okay?

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.825
What is "not" jokes?

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.704
A "not" joke is when we're trying
to make fun of something

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:13.917
and what we do is we make
a statement that we pretend is true

00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:17.754
but, at the end, we say, "Not,"
which means it's not true.

00:13:17.838 --> 00:13:19.172
So teach me how to make one.

00:13:19.256 --> 00:13:22.258
- All right, what color is your suit?
- This suit is gray.

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:23.927
Gray, I would call it blue, okay?

00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:25.553
- It's gray.
- All right, it's blue-gray.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:28.306
But it's certainly not black, right?

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.100
- Let's say it's gray, but...
- It is gray.

00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:35.146
Okay, so a "not" joke, I would say

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:38.149
"That suit is black. Not!"

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:41.486
This suit is not black.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.322
- No, no, "Not" has to be the end.
- Oh, okay.

00:13:44.406 --> 00:13:46.533
This suit is black not.

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:49.452
This suit is black, pause...
You know what a pause is?

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:52.831
- Yes.
- This suit is black. Not!

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:56.167
This suit is black. Pause. Not.

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.253
No, you don't say "pause."

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.088
This suit is black.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.174
That's a pause. Not!

00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:05.635
This suit is black.

00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:08.930
Okay...

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:11.850
- I don't... I'm not...
- Not!

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:19.858
Everybody say U.S.A.
television much better

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:22.986
but this I watch for three hours,
do not change.

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:24.696
There's a remote control here.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.282
Push these two arrows
to change the channel.

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:31.536
I got him, I got him, I got him!

00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:35.707
I have the urge to bury something else.

00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:36.875
Yes!

00:14:38.627 --> 00:14:42.171
- I love you.
- I love you too, Jamie.

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:43.965
I love you.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.905
- Do you believe in magic, Miss...
- Parker, C.J.

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:09.699
It's a pleasure to meet you, C.J.

00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:16.915
Be careful! Be careful, C.J.!

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:21.753
This C.J. was like no
Kazakh woman I had ever seen.

00:15:21.837 --> 00:15:26.758
She had golden hairs,
teeth as white as pearls

00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:29.344
and the asshole of a 7-year-old.

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:33.389
For the first time in my lifes,

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:35.099
l was in love.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.689
Get up! Get up!

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.900
Why aren't you ready!

00:15:43.984 --> 00:15:45.652
We have people to interview today.

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:46.736
I understand.

00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:49.948
Learn what you can from
this women's group.

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:52.951
- My hair?
- It's beautiful. Don't worry.

00:15:55.871 --> 00:16:00.541
In Kazakhstan it is illegal for more than
five woman to be in the same place

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:03.419
except for in brothel or in grave.

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:07.840
In the U.S. and A., many womens meet
in groups called Feminists.

00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:09.175
I find more.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.804
VETERAN FEMINISTS
OF AMERICA

00:16:12.888 --> 00:16:14.806
So, what means this feminism?

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:19.811
It's the theory that women
should be equal to men

00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:23.314
in matters economic, social...

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:25.650
- Now you are laughing.
- Yes.

00:16:25.734 --> 00:16:27.652
Well, that is the problem.

00:16:27.736 --> 00:16:30.363
Do you think a woman should be educate?

00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:31.739
Definitely.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:36.160
But is it not a problem that a woman
have a smaller brain than a man?

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:37.495
That is wrong.

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:41.457
But the government scientist,
Dr. Yamak, prove it's the size of squirrel.

00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:43.251
Your government's scientist?

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:46.045
- Yes, Dr. Yamak.
- He's wrong. He's wrong.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.589
Give me a smile, baby. Why angry face?

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:52.552
Well, what you're saying
is very demeaning.

00:16:52.636 --> 00:16:55.263
- Do you know the word "demeaning"?
- No.

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.181
We are saying to you...

00:16:57.266 --> 00:17:01.144
l could not concentrate on what
this old man was saying.

00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:07.900
All I could think about was this
lovely woman in her red water-panties.

00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:10.028
Who was this C.J.?

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:13.614
Last night I see in my hotel room

00:17:14.616 --> 00:17:17.452
a woman called C.J. on the television.

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:19.537
- Do you know her?
- No.

00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:22.915
She from a town called Baywatches.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.710
- She's just on television.
- Her name is Pamela.

00:17:25.794 --> 00:17:28.713
- Do she live here in New York City?
- She lives in California.

00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:31.215
- In the California.
- He's gonna look her up.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.800
Okay, can we finish now?

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.677
Listen, pussycat, smile a bit.

00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:38.431
- All right. That's it. I'm done.
- We're finished. We have to leave.

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:45.897
Although I was obsessed
by this C.J., I could not pursue her

00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:48.816
or else my wife would snap off my cock.

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:55.156
Mr. Sagdiyev?

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.034
- Yes?
- I have a telegram for you.

00:17:58.118 --> 00:18:00.661
- You can read?
- Yes, I can.

00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:04.457
"Dear Borat Sagdiyev,

00:18:04.541 --> 00:18:07.376
"your wife, Oxna,

00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:12.965
"was walking your retarded Bilo
in the woods

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.886
"when a bear attacked
and violated and break her.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.263
"She is now dead."

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:21.766
You say my wife is dead?

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:24.852
This is what it's...

00:18:32.152 --> 00:18:36.405
Yes, sir. I'm sorry to inform you,
but that's what the telegram says.

00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:39.951
High five! Great!

00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:57.426
What do you mean, California?

00:18:57.511 --> 00:19:00.304
I have arranged all our filming
for New York.

00:19:00.889 --> 00:19:03.641
But we need to leave New York
to find the real America:

00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:07.103
rodeos, cowboys...
It will be better for our documentary.

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:09.647
But why California?
What's there?

00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:14.402
Pearl Harbor is there...
And so is Texas.

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:19.240
Eventually, I persuade Azamat
that we would travel to California

00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:22.076
and make our reportings along the way.

00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:28.082
He insists we not fly in case the Jews
repeated their attack of 9/11.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:31.586
Okay, I'll find another way
for us to get there.

00:19:32.379 --> 00:19:34.463
My name is Mike.
I'm gonna be your driving instructor.

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:36.007
MICHAEL PSENICSKA
Perry Hall Driving School

00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:37.091
Welcome to our country, okay.

00:19:37.217 --> 00:19:38.634
- My name Borat.
- Okay, okay. Good, good.

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:41.262
Well, I'm not used to that,
but that's fine.

00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:44.599
Now, you do know how to drive a little bit?

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:47.226
- Yes.
- Yes. Put it in D.

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.520
- What?
- Drive.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.818
Now, wait a second. Wait a second.

00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:58.738
- Have you driven a car before?
- Yes, many times.

00:19:58.822 --> 00:20:00.156
All right, let's go this way.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.491
I don't want you hitting anybody.

00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:04.285
Use two hands, now.

00:20:05.495 --> 00:20:07.121
- What?
- Two hands.

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:10.374
But then it look like I am holding
a Gypsy while he eat my chram.

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:13.836
I don't care.
You use two hands when you drive, okay?

00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:15.463
Okay.

00:20:19.635 --> 00:20:22.094
- Okay.
- Watch the children.

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:24.096
Okay, no problem.

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:26.807
You must not hit the children.

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:28.893
Look, there is a woman in a car.

00:20:28.977 --> 00:20:30.186
Can we follow her?

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.647
- And maybe make sexy-time with her?
- No, no, no.

00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:34.649
- Let's get her. Why not?
- No, no, no.

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:38.861
Because a woman has a right
to choose who she has sex with.

00:20:38.946 --> 00:20:41.364
- What? You joke?
- How about that? Isn't that amazing?

00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:44.575
There must be consent. How about that?

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:46.661
That's good, huh?

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:49.622
- Is not good for me.
- It is good.

00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:51.582
- Steer the car.
- Okay.

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:54.085
- You want have a drink?
- You can't drink that.

00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:56.754
- Why not? What?
- It's against the law.

00:20:59.007 --> 00:21:01.884
Who is this car that follow us?
I wish it didn't follow us.

00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:03.761
- I don't know.
- Maybe we'll lose them.

00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:05.680
No, we better not lose them.

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:09.725
Hey, don't look at me. Eat my tits!

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.602
We'll make a right turn up here.

00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:14.855
Don't look at me like that.
I will eat your shit.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.983
- Hey, you fuck my mother!
- Hey, hey.

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:19.610
- No, he do before. He look on me.
- You can't do that.

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:22.154
They're gonna throw us in jail,
me with you.

00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:24.782
Why in a jail? He look on me.

00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:27.285
- Behind.
- You can't say that.

00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:28.953
I like you, do you like me?

00:21:29.037 --> 00:21:31.539
- I do like you.
- You are my friend?

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:33.624
You're nice and I am your friend.

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:35.001
You will be my boyfriend?

00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:38.379
- I won't be your boyfriend.
- Why not? You do not like me?

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:41.841
I could be. It depends.
Well, boyfriend, yeah, I can.

00:21:42.884 --> 00:21:44.468
Great success.

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:47.638
Now time to make purchase of motorcars.

00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:52.018
I want to have a car that attract
a woman with a shave down below.

00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:54.937
Well, that would be a Corvette
or a Hummer.

00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:56.188
JIM SELL
GM Salesman

00:21:56.273 --> 00:21:58.399
We will try to help you out here.

00:21:59.901 --> 00:22:03.529
A man yesterday tell me if I buy a car

00:22:03.613 --> 00:22:05.823
I must buy one with a pussy magnet.

00:22:05.907 --> 00:22:07.783
He means a car that women will like.

00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:09.994
Yes, but where you keep this magnet?

00:22:10.078 --> 00:22:12.830
No, there's no magnet. That was just...
He means the vehicle.

00:22:12.914 --> 00:22:14.248
Women love the Hummers.

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:16.834
- Do this have a pussy magnet?
- No.

00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:18.586
The vehicle itself will be a magnet.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:24.050
If I give you good price,
will you please put in pussy magnet?

00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:28.054
Yeah, but there's no such thing
in this country as a magnet.

00:22:28.638 --> 00:22:31.974
If this car drive into a group of Gypsy,

00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:34.185
will there be any damage to the car?

00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:37.188
- It depends on how hard you hit them.
- Hard.

00:22:37.272 --> 00:22:38.689
Yeah, hard. You might,

00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:42.526
if somebody rolls on the windshield,
crack your windshield.

00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:45.863
How fast do I need to go
to guarantee I kill him?

00:22:45.947 --> 00:22:48.824
Let me tell you something,
with this vehicle, probably doing 35,

00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:51.369
- 40 miles an hour would do it.
- Great.

00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:55.122
When I buy my wife,

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:58.376
at the start, she was cook good,

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.796
her vagina work well
and she strong on plow.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.091
But after three years, when she was 15,

00:23:05.175 --> 00:23:10.721
then she become weak, her voice
become deep, "Borat, Borat."

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:14.725
She receive hair on chest

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.312
and her vagina hang like sleeve of wizard.

00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:20.523
Huh. Jeez.

00:23:20.982 --> 00:23:24.819
How do I know that
this will not happen with a car?

00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:28.155
Chevrolet guarantees that with a warranty.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.117
I like very much buy this Hummers.

00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:33.744
- How much is it?
- 52,000.

00:23:34.162 --> 00:23:40.751
I am looking for something between
$600 to $650.

00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:43.838
We don't have any cars for 650
that you can buy.

00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:46.048
I might be able to sell you
a wholesale car.

00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:48.551
A car with a lot of miles for 700
with no warranty.

00:23:48.635 --> 00:23:49.885
- Okay.
- Come on.

00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:04.567
California, I coming!

00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:17.913
First stops on our journey
was Washington, D.C.,

00:24:17.998 --> 00:24:21.459
home of mighty U.S. warlord,
Premier Bush.

00:24:22.627 --> 00:24:23.836
Look who has an embassy here!

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.381
Uzbekistan. Fuck you, motherfuckers!

00:24:28.258 --> 00:24:31.635
We arrive here to learn
from American politic.

00:24:32.095 --> 00:24:35.848
Azamat arrange interview
with Party official from ruling regime.

00:24:35.932 --> 00:24:37.099
BOB BARR
Former Georgia Congressman

00:24:37.184 --> 00:24:41.061
- We are good friend, Bob Barr, yes?
- I hope so.

00:24:41.229 --> 00:24:46.233
It is a custom have cheese at the start.

00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:49.153
Thank you.

00:24:49.696 --> 00:24:53.282
My wife, she make this cheese.

00:24:53.366 --> 00:24:54.950
Very nice.

00:24:55.035 --> 00:24:57.536
She make it from milk from her tit.

00:25:05.795 --> 00:25:11.133
After interview, I encounters
traditional American street festival.

00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:15.513
GAY PRIDE PARADE

00:25:17.557 --> 00:25:21.602
People here were much more friendly
than in New York.

00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:33.364
Next morning, I interview politician
who is a genuine chocolate-face.

00:25:33.448 --> 00:25:34.990
No makeup.

00:25:35.075 --> 00:25:36.283
ALAN KEYES
2-time Republican Presidential Candidate

00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:38.702
On Sunday, I arrive in Washington.

00:25:38.787 --> 00:25:40.538
There was a parade.

00:25:40.622 --> 00:25:43.874
I make two friends from this parade.

00:25:43.959 --> 00:25:46.794
I invite them back my hotel room.

00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:49.505
We drink like normal in Kazakhstan.

00:25:49.589 --> 00:25:52.216
We wrestle like normal in Kazakhstan.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.470
Then they say, "I wash you in a shower,"
and he wash me in a shower.

00:25:56.805 --> 00:25:59.932
It sounds like
you met somebody who is from

00:26:00.016 --> 00:26:02.351
what is called in America,
the gay community.

00:26:02.435 --> 00:26:05.354
- What it mean, "Gay," this word?
- Homosexual.

00:26:05.814 --> 00:26:07.856
A homosexual? You mean...

00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:17.950
Are you telling me the man
who try to put a rubber fist in my anus

00:26:18.034 --> 00:26:19.827
was a homosexual?

00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:27.960
Even though my anus was broken

00:26:28.044 --> 00:26:32.089
I knew that rest of our journey
would be great success.

00:26:32.173 --> 00:26:35.968
We left Washington
and continued towards California.

00:26:36.344 --> 00:26:37.720
Howdy, partners!

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:41.849
Yes, minister, we're on schedule.

00:26:42.684 --> 00:26:45.185
Yes, I'm standing in
the middle of Times Square.

00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:48.480
It's time to prepare for your
TV appearance.

00:26:48.565 --> 00:26:51.942
Remember to talk of singing
national anthem at rodeo.

00:26:52.027 --> 00:26:53.944
Don't worry, I am a TV professional.

00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:57.281
Now, building our station around you.

00:26:57.365 --> 00:27:00.618
This is 16 WAPT News This Morning,

00:27:00.702 --> 00:27:04.288
named best newscast in the state
by the Associated Press.

00:27:04.372 --> 00:27:07.249
This morning we have
a special guest here in the studio.

00:27:07.334 --> 00:27:09.376
This is Borhat Sagadiyev.

00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:13.130
He is traveling across America to get the
taste of life here in the United States.

00:27:13.214 --> 00:27:15.090
He spent the last few days here.

00:27:15.175 --> 00:27:18.469
- Good morning to you.
- Hello, my name Borat. Hello.

00:27:18.553 --> 00:27:20.638
Hello. Thank you.

00:27:21.681 --> 00:27:25.684
Before we start, can you tell me,
because I want make urines,

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:29.063
then I come back here and...

00:27:29.147 --> 00:27:31.857
If you tell me one minute
before we start...

00:27:31.941 --> 00:27:35.986
We started.
We are actually live on the air right now.

00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:38.447

00:27:38.531 --> 00:27:43.118
Hello, U.S. and A.! Hello, U.S. and A.!

00:27:43.203 --> 00:27:45.496

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.081
And hello!

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:49.750
Hello to you as well.

00:27:49.834 --> 00:27:52.753
Now, real quickly, why are you here
in the United States?

00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:57.508
Because I want to learn from U.S. and A,

00:27:57.592 --> 00:28:04.515
your culture, and to understand
from how a thing happen

00:28:04.599 --> 00:28:07.351
and to take this lesson
back to my country.

00:28:07.435 --> 00:28:10.104
- All right. Would you like to have a seat?
- Yes.

00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:12.022
Please sit, please sit, please sit.

00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:14.566
Now, one of the things
that you've enjoyed so much about...

00:28:14.651 --> 00:28:17.861
Can I have a microphone
so people can hear me?

00:28:17.946 --> 00:28:20.322
They can hear you right now.
You are miked up.

00:28:20.407 --> 00:28:22.116
This right here, that's the microphone.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.993
Hello. Hello, nice meet you.

00:28:25.787 --> 00:28:29.707
Well, welcome to the United States.
Thank you very much for coming on.

00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:32.251
When you come to Kazakhstan,

00:28:32.335 --> 00:28:35.212
- you can stay in my house.
- Well, thank you so much.

00:28:35.296 --> 00:28:38.006
You can sleep my house
and you can use my sister.

00:28:38.091 --> 00:28:40.300
Meteorologist Ken Johnson
will have the latest

00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:43.178
on tropical storm Emily when we return.

00:28:43.763 --> 00:28:45.431
Ten seconds, stand by.

00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:49.601
This is 16 WAPT News This Morning.

00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:52.396
Traffic is flowing along smoothly
along Interstate 55.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.815
Dry conditions.
If you're heading to the north,

00:28:54.899 --> 00:28:57.901
not too far away from Attala County,
there's some showers there.

00:28:57.986 --> 00:29:01.238
Check that out on
the radar this morning and...

00:29:01.322 --> 00:29:04.575
Thank you, very nice for have me.

00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:06.118
What your name?

00:29:06.202 --> 00:29:08.245
We're on air right now doing the weather.

00:29:08.329 --> 00:29:10.581
- What your name?
- We're doing the weather right now.

00:29:10.665 --> 00:29:13.792
Go over here with Adrian.
She's calling you to go over here.

00:29:13.877 --> 00:29:15.669
- It is a she?
- Yes.

00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:19.006

00:29:20.884 --> 00:29:22.885

00:29:22.969 --> 00:29:24.720
I'm the weather guy.

00:29:26.848 --> 00:29:28.015
Okay...

00:29:30.477 --> 00:29:33.854
Let's go over to the weather.
You can see the radar, right now

00:29:33.938 --> 00:29:37.483
showing some showers
and storms up to the north...

00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:40.402
Okay. All right, let me...

00:29:40.487 --> 00:29:41.820
Nice to meet you.

00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:45.032
Showers and storms north of Yazoo City
up towards Kosciusko...

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.867
Thank you, bye-bye.

00:29:49.162 --> 00:29:51.038
You're singing at a rodeo tonight!

00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:53.624
Why didn't you mention it?

00:29:53.708 --> 00:29:56.335
What can I do, they are not
professional.

00:29:57.337 --> 00:30:01.215
Get a move on, we have
100 miles to go.

00:30:03.343 --> 00:30:05.636
We welcome you to the 38th annual

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.056
Kroger Valleydale Championship Rodeo.

00:30:30.662 --> 00:30:33.413
Of course, every picture that we get back

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:34.665
BOBBY ROWE
General Manager, Imperial Rodeo

00:30:34.749 --> 00:30:40.045
from the terrorists or anything else,
the Muslims, they look like you,

00:30:40.129 --> 00:30:42.339
- black hair and a black mustache.
- Yes.

00:30:42.423 --> 00:30:46.635
Shave that dadgummed mustache off
so you're not so conspicuous.

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:49.972
So you look like maybe an Italian
or something

00:30:50.056 --> 00:30:52.850
as far as when people looking at you.

00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:55.394
I see a lot of people and I think,
"There's a dadgummed Muslim.

00:30:55.478 --> 00:30:58.355
"I wonder what kind of bomb
he's got strapped to him."

00:30:58.439 --> 00:31:00.816
- Yes.
- And you probably aren't a Muslim.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.361
- Maybe that's not your religion.
- No, I am a Kazakh. I follow the hawk.

00:31:04.445 --> 00:31:06.738
But you look like one of them.

00:31:06.823 --> 00:31:09.199
This thing gets over with
and when we win it

00:31:09.284 --> 00:31:11.118
and kick the butts over there

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:13.412
and all of them son-of-a-bucks
hanging from the gallows,

00:31:13.496 --> 00:31:16.623
by that time, you will have proven yourself

00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:18.542
and you'll be accepted.

00:31:18.626 --> 00:31:19.793
- Take care.
- Thank you.

00:31:19.878 --> 00:31:22.212
- I ain't gonna kiss you.
- Why not?

00:31:22.297 --> 00:31:25.883
The people that do the kissing
are the ones that float around like that.

00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:29.136
- Are they all...
- Yeah. Stay away from them that kiss.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.971
- Okay.
- You don't want nobody kissing.

00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:35.100
In my country they take them to jail
and finish them.

00:31:35.184 --> 00:31:36.810
- Take them and hang them.
- Yes.

00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:39.813
- That's what we're trying to get done.
- High five.

00:31:40.607 --> 00:31:42.190
Ladies and gentlemen of Salem, Virginia,

00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:44.985
would you please give a warm,
American welcome

00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:48.906
to a gentleman who has come
all the way from Kazakhstan

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:52.701
and we are honored
to have singing our national anthem.

00:31:52.785 --> 00:31:56.163
Ladies and gentlemen, Borat Sagdiyev.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:09.134
My name Borat. I come from Kazakhstan.

00:32:09.218 --> 00:32:14.598
Can I say first,
we support your war of terror.

00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:22.272
May we show our support
to our boys in Iraq.

00:32:24.651 --> 00:32:29.029
May U.S. and A.
kill every single terrorist.

00:32:34.077 --> 00:32:36.662
May your George Bush drink the blood

00:32:36.746 --> 00:32:40.540
of every single man, woman
and child of Iraq.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.000
Yeah!

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:48.090
May you destroy their country
so that for the next thousand years

00:32:48.174 --> 00:32:52.177
not even a single lizard
will survive in their desert.

00:32:53.554 --> 00:32:55.514
To show our friendship,

00:32:55.598 --> 00:32:59.351
I now will sing
our Kazakh national anthem

00:32:59.435 --> 00:33:02.145
to the tune of your national anthem.

00:33:03.064 --> 00:33:04.564
Please stand.

00:33:06.067 --> 00:33:09.736
Kazakhstan is the greatest

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:12.990
Country in the world

00:33:13.074 --> 00:33:16.034
All other countries

00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:19.788
Are run by little girls

00:33:19.872 --> 00:33:22.833
Kazakhstan is number one

00:33:22.917 --> 00:33:26.420
Exporter of potassium

00:33:26.546 --> 00:33:30.048
Other Central Asian countries

00:33:30.133 --> 00:33:33.510
Have inferior potassium

00:33:33.594 --> 00:33:36.847
Kazakhstan is the greatest

00:33:36.931 --> 00:33:39.558
Country in the world

00:33:39.642 --> 00:33:41.935
All other countries

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.563
Is the home of the gays

00:33:56.534 --> 00:34:00.037
We nearly died last night.
This journey is cursed.

00:34:00.455 --> 00:34:02.414
We should have stayed in New York.

00:34:02.665 --> 00:34:04.082
l was sad.

00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:06.835
The rodeo peoples did not like me.

00:34:06.919 --> 00:34:09.588
What if Pamela did not like me too?

00:34:09.672 --> 00:34:13.300
We needed something
to change our fortunes.

00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:15.343
Look, Azamat, a Gypsy village.

00:34:16.387 --> 00:34:19.931
Let us extract some of their tears
so we can remove the curse.

00:34:20.308 --> 00:34:24.019
Do not fear me, Gypsy,
all I want from you is your tears.

00:34:24.103 --> 00:34:26.938
Please give them to me or I will take them.

00:34:27.857 --> 00:34:28.940
I'm not a Gypsy.

00:34:29.025 --> 00:34:32.152
I'm a Midwestern
farmer's daughter. Americana.

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:34.988
You have many treasures.
Who did you rob for this?

00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:37.532
We didn't rob them.
They came from the house.

00:34:37.617 --> 00:34:40.202
I will look in your treasures, Gypsy.

00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:43.955
Is this understood? I will look on them.

00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:45.749
Please do.

00:34:49.003 --> 00:34:51.463
Who is this lady you have shrunk?

00:34:51.547 --> 00:34:54.424
Was she the owner of this house
that you camp in front of?

00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:56.885
There's a couple more child's dolls.

00:34:56.969 --> 00:35:00.555
Do not try and shrink me, Gypsy. I serious.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.724
- These are your spells?
- No.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.727
There's a good one,
The Millionaire Mindset.

00:35:06.187 --> 00:35:08.480
There you go.

00:35:08.564 --> 00:35:10.899
- Baywatch.
- Baywatch?

00:35:17.031 --> 00:35:18.824
It means she love me.

00:35:23.037 --> 00:35:24.162
Azamat!

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:26.832
Azamat, great success!
I've got the tears.

00:35:26.916 --> 00:35:28.333
Onwards to California!

00:35:28.668 --> 00:35:30.127
Let's go.

00:35:30.419 --> 00:35:31.461
What's that you've got there?

00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:33.630
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

00:35:47.353 --> 00:35:49.521
Are we going the right way?

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:52.524
- I don't know, this map is from 1917.
- Where the hell are we?

00:35:57.321 --> 00:35:59.322
Hey, stop that goddamn van!

00:36:00.366 --> 00:36:03.577
Hey, baby, want to go out?
Wanna go out, honey?

00:36:07.748 --> 00:36:10.333
I'm going to stop and ask.

00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:13.420
No, no, no, keep going. Keep going.

00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:18.717
I need the direction to California, please.

00:36:18.801 --> 00:36:20.635
- To California?
- You a long way from home.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.263
Who you with, man?
Who you with, who you with?

00:36:23.347 --> 00:36:27.851
I travel with my friend, Azamat Bagatov.
We travel across the country.

00:36:27.935 --> 00:36:31.730
You can't be talking all that.
You gotta be talking English right here.

00:36:31.814 --> 00:36:34.983
You look like Michael Jackson, Beat lt.

00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:36.943
Man, you better...

00:36:39.363 --> 00:36:42.908
I like you peoples.
Can you teach me how to dress?

00:36:42.992 --> 00:36:44.784
How can I be like you?

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:47.037
You need to let them jeans down.

00:36:47.121 --> 00:36:48.371
Pull them down?

00:36:48.456 --> 00:36:50.207
Don't pull them down like...

00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:52.250
- Like a ho?
- No, no, no.

00:36:52.335 --> 00:36:54.211
- Like a this?
- Yeah.

00:36:54.295 --> 00:36:56.671
But don't show your Huggies though, man.

00:36:57.131 --> 00:36:59.174
What the hell? Is that fishnet?

00:36:59.258 --> 00:37:02.135
No, no, no, these are my antipants.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.680
- What kind of music you listen to?
- I like very much Corky Bucek.

00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:07.307
You know Corky Bucek?

00:37:09.018 --> 00:37:10.393
No, no, no.

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:14.231
You got to lick it before you stick it.

00:37:15.358 --> 00:37:17.400
Can you teach me speak like you?

00:37:17.485 --> 00:37:18.693
What you trying to say?

00:37:18.778 --> 00:37:22.113
- How you say, "How do you do?"
- What's up with it?

00:37:22.198 --> 00:37:23.990
- What's that with it?
- Yeah.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.827
Pull over and let's see
if we can stay here.

00:37:36.128 --> 00:37:38.421
What's up with it, vanilla-face?

00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:41.591
Me and my homey, Azamat,
just parked our slab outside.

00:37:41.676 --> 00:37:42.759
Please.

00:37:42.843 --> 00:37:46.596
We are looking for somewhere to
post up our black asses for the night.

00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:49.432
So bang-bang, skeet-skeet, nigga.

00:37:50.518 --> 00:37:52.310
We just a couple of pimps, no ho's.

00:37:52.395 --> 00:37:54.688
- Sir, you gotta leave.
- Okay.

00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:58.108
Leave now or we're gonna call the cops
and we'll have you taken out.

00:37:58.192 --> 00:38:02.570
We can't stay here,
they are player haters.

00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:13.081
- Hi. Hello.
- You have a room for tonight?

00:38:13.165 --> 00:38:15.166
Oh, yes. Yes, definitely.

00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:17.377
- Come on in.
- Great.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:19.796
Your friend also.

00:38:22.049 --> 00:38:24.342
A beautiful house, this.

00:38:24.427 --> 00:38:27.512
All the paintings in the house, I did.

00:38:27.596 --> 00:38:28.847
What is this man?

00:38:28.931 --> 00:38:33.852
This is a Yemenite Jew
and he's working on a piece of jewelry.

00:38:34.228 --> 00:38:39.065
They, Yemenites, were also jewelers.

00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:41.526
Why you have a picture of a Jew?

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:46.906
Because I'm Jewish,
so I have lots of pictures of Jews.

00:38:52.705 --> 00:38:55.623
This is the room and...

00:38:57.501 --> 00:39:01.171
- Do you need two pillows?
- Yes.

00:39:01.255 --> 00:39:03.590
Great. Thank you. Lovely place.

00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:09.095
- They're Jews.
- I know that now.

00:39:09.555 --> 00:39:11.181
They'll kill us.
We need to escape.

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:27.864
- Wait, wait.
- Okay.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:31.117
Hello.

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:34.245
- How are you?
- Great.

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:35.955
You guys getting settled in?

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.708
This is a special sandwich for you.

00:39:38.793 --> 00:39:43.421
I not so hungry. He can eat this.

00:39:43.506 --> 00:39:44.714
He fat.

00:39:45.466 --> 00:39:46.966
No, no.

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:49.052
- You gonna eat, because...
- Take a half.

00:39:49.136 --> 00:39:51.846
- Take a half and then you'll see.
- Take a half.

00:39:51.931 --> 00:39:53.515
Yeah. I not so hungry.

00:39:53.599 --> 00:39:55.392
You eat a little bit.

00:40:00.189 --> 00:40:03.233
Go ahead and eat something
because you're hungry.

00:40:03.317 --> 00:40:04.401
Yes.

00:40:12.535 --> 00:40:15.703
I don't want to see you go hungry.

00:40:15.788 --> 00:40:18.331
What is this picture over here?

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:19.999
Okay...

00:40:27.341 --> 00:40:29.426
It is 3:00 in the morning.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.387
I am in a nest of Jews.

00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:35.014
They have cleverly shifted their shapes.

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:39.185
One of them has taken the form
of a little old woman.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.188
You can barely see her horns.

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:46.151
She have tried to poison me already.

00:40:46.902 --> 00:40:48.945
These rats are very clever.

00:40:56.495 --> 00:40:58.121
Look, the Jews have
shifted their shapes.

00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:02.000
OK, OK. How much shall
I give them?

00:41:02.334 --> 00:41:04.794
I don't know...

00:41:06.505 --> 00:41:08.047
More. Give them more.

00:41:11.218 --> 00:41:12.719
Go. Go.

00:41:27.943 --> 00:41:30.320
Let's go back to New York,
at least there's no Jews there.

00:41:30.404 --> 00:41:32.155
Calm down.
We'll keep heading to California.

00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:34.115
Why California?
What's so special about California?

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.492
We are going to California!

00:41:35.576 --> 00:41:36.910
And get killed on the way?

00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:41.664
Relax, Azamat!
I will get us protection.

00:41:44.126 --> 00:41:47.253
What is the best gun
to defend from a Jew?

00:41:50.382 --> 00:41:54.427
I would recommend
either a 9 millimeter or a .45.

00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:58.932
Very nice.

00:42:00.768 --> 00:42:05.230
It like I movie star, Dirty Harold.

00:42:05.314 --> 00:42:08.066
- Yes, sir.
- Come on and make my day, Jew.

00:42:09.985 --> 00:42:14.030
But he would not sell me gun
since I not American.

00:42:14.114 --> 00:42:16.449
So I look for other protection.

00:42:17.409 --> 00:42:19.661
MUNCH RANCH
Exotic Animal Dealer

00:42:19.745 --> 00:42:23.581
- What type of dog is this?
- This is a tortoise.

00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:26.292
Is this a cat in a hat?

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:28.670
No, it's a tortoise in a shell.

00:42:28.754 --> 00:42:30.505
Yes.

00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:32.966
I need animal for protection.

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:35.260
What you have for me?

00:43:00.786 --> 00:43:03.329
We're safe.
Now we continue to California.

00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:05.540
High five!

00:43:05.624 --> 00:43:07.333
Great! Nice.

00:43:22.099 --> 00:43:23.850
Switch it off.

00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:25.268
It so annoying!

00:43:41.076 --> 00:43:45.079
Happy times. We were safe
and well on our way to Pamela.

00:43:45.414 --> 00:43:47.707
It was time to get back to work.

00:43:49.501 --> 00:43:54.756
Kazakhstan needs to learn
about American fine dining.

00:43:55.966 --> 00:43:57.967
First, a lady will
teach you southern manners.

00:43:58.177 --> 00:43:59.469
How long have I got?

00:43:59.553 --> 00:44:03.556
An hour. Then you have
dinner date with high society.

00:44:06.185 --> 00:44:07.852
Hello and nice meet you.

00:44:07.936 --> 00:44:10.521
Hello, it's so nice to meet you.
Welcome to America.

00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:11.856
KATHIE B. MARTIN
Etiquette Coach

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:16.944
Will you please teach me
how to dine like gentleman?

00:44:17.529 --> 00:44:19.572
Of course, I'll be happy to.

00:44:22.117 --> 00:44:24.827
Is it polite to greet people
when I make entry?

00:44:24.912 --> 00:44:25.995
THE MAGNOLIA MANSION
Dining Society

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.413
Yes, it is.

00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:30.917
- Let me introduce you around.
- Yes.

00:44:31.001 --> 00:44:34.295
- You're gonna have to...
- I'm Mike. Mike Jared.

00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:37.924
Hello, I'm Bethany Weston.

00:44:38.008 --> 00:44:39.258
- Lovely to see you.
- Nice.

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:42.178
- How you do?
- How do you do? My name's Ben.

00:44:45.474 --> 00:44:50.603
Should I pay interest in peoples
around the table-sides?

00:44:50.938 --> 00:44:52.146
Yes.

00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:55.692
And, if it is a big table,
a very long table,

00:44:55.776 --> 00:44:58.027
you might want to restrict
your conversation...

00:44:58.112 --> 00:45:01.364
- Yes.
- ...to people right in your vicinity.

00:45:01.448 --> 00:45:03.991
- Very nice.
- So you are not yelling.

00:45:08.455 --> 00:45:09.997
What do you do?

00:45:10.082 --> 00:45:12.875
- I'm the pastor of a church.
- Yes.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.713
- What do you do?
- I have spent years in construction.

00:45:16.797 --> 00:45:20.133
I'm recently retired.

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:22.677
- You are retard?
- Yes.

00:45:22.761 --> 00:45:24.929
Physical or mental?

00:45:26.181 --> 00:45:29.392
- Retired.
- No, no, not retarded.

00:45:29.476 --> 00:45:31.978
- I don't work anymore.
- Stopped working.

00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:35.982
It's very good you allow retard

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:39.902
to eat with you in the same place.

00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:43.156
That's not what
we're saying about this man.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.577
He is not what
you would refer to as retard.

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:51.080
- No.
- No, no. Not at all.

00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:53.791
Do you have a telephone in this village?

00:45:54.168 --> 00:45:55.501
Of course.

00:46:02.509 --> 00:46:04.927
Should I show photos of my family?

00:46:05.012 --> 00:46:07.847
You have photos
of your family? Wonderful.

00:46:09.308 --> 00:46:11.684
This my favorite son, Huey Lewis.

00:46:12.311 --> 00:46:14.270
- Okay.
- Yes.

00:46:14.354 --> 00:46:16.230
- He looks happy.
- Yes.

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:19.817
He very strong.

00:46:19.902 --> 00:46:23.780
- My goodness, is that him holding you?
- Yes. Very strong.

00:46:23.864 --> 00:46:28.534
He grow three centimeter.
He now 17 centimeter long.

00:46:30.537 --> 00:46:35.416
I'm not sure I would show
these photos of him without clothes on.

00:46:35.501 --> 00:46:39.420
Should I pay compliments to the peoples?

00:46:39.546 --> 00:46:44.383
Yes, but only if you truly agree
with that compliment.

00:46:44.927 --> 00:46:48.513
You have a very gentle face

00:46:48.597 --> 00:46:52.767
- and a very erotic physique.
- Thank you.

00:46:53.185 --> 00:46:54.727
- You're correct.
- Yes.

00:46:54.812 --> 00:46:56.729
That's a very good observation.

00:46:56.814 --> 00:46:58.815
She is your wife?

00:46:58.899 --> 00:47:00.691
Nope. That's my wife.

00:47:00.776 --> 00:47:06.697
In my country,
they would go crazy for these two.

00:47:06.782 --> 00:47:08.199
Not so much.

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:18.084
What should I say if
I need to go to the shit hole?

00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:20.878
You mean to the restroom?

00:47:20.963 --> 00:47:24.507
- To the place to make the shit.
- The bathroom? Okay. What you...

00:47:24.591 --> 00:47:26.425
Not to bath. To make dirt from anus.

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:29.387
- Not a bath, right. The toilet.
- The brown...

00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:32.348
- Where you make... You understand?
- Yes. Yes.

00:47:32.432 --> 00:47:34.642
- Bad? Bad thing from it.
- Yes.

00:47:36.103 --> 00:47:37.186
Brown.

00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:41.440
What you do is you say, "Excuse me,
I need to go to the restroom."

00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:47.363
Excuse me, is it possible
to go and do a, you know...

00:47:47.447 --> 00:47:49.949
- To be excused?
- How you say in the, you know...

00:47:50.033 --> 00:47:52.869
Upstairs. Just say,
"Excuse me a moment."

00:47:52.995 --> 00:47:56.664
- I need to go, what you say...
- That works. Thank you.

00:47:56.748 --> 00:47:59.917
- Can you go upstairs?
- Yes, thank you.

00:48:00.002 --> 00:48:05.089
I think that the cultural differences
are vast...

00:48:05.173 --> 00:48:08.092
- Exactly.
- ...and I think he's a delightful man

00:48:08.176 --> 00:48:14.307
and it wouldn't take very much time
for him to really become Americanized.

00:48:14.933 --> 00:48:16.434
Thank you very much. I feel much better.

00:48:16.518 --> 00:48:18.728
- Cindy, where shall I put this?
- Just...

00:48:18.812 --> 00:48:20.897
Where should I put this?

00:48:25.027 --> 00:48:27.278
Maybe in the other restroom down here.

00:48:27.362 --> 00:48:28.613
In the...

00:48:30.032 --> 00:48:33.159
Excuse me...
Excuse me for just a moment, please.

00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:37.747
You roll off like this

00:48:37.831 --> 00:48:41.459
and you wipe your bottom
and you put the paper... Look.

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:43.419
- You, wipe mine?
- No, I don't. You do.

00:48:43.503 --> 00:48:47.590
- This is a very private thing.
- The host cleans the anus of the other?

00:48:47.674 --> 00:48:51.928
No, no, no.
Nobody touches you, except you.

00:48:52.512 --> 00:48:54.722
Can I bring a guest to dinner?

00:48:55.515 --> 00:48:58.601
If you have been invited
to a home or to a party...

00:48:58.685 --> 00:49:02.605
- Yes.
- ...it is acceptable to bring a guest

00:49:02.689 --> 00:49:05.733
- if you ask your host in advance.
- Yes.

00:49:05.817 --> 00:49:07.944
General Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee.

00:49:08.028 --> 00:49:12.782
- I think this my friend. Hello?
- Hi, I'm looking for Borat.

00:49:12.866 --> 00:49:15.034
- Yes, it's me.
- Oh, hi, honey.

00:49:15.202 --> 00:49:18.454
- I'm Luenell. Hi, hi.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

00:49:18.538 --> 00:49:20.748
- This my friend, Luenell.
- Hi.

00:49:21.416 --> 00:49:23.626
Oh, okay...

00:49:25.879 --> 00:49:27.630
You all having a dinner party.

00:49:27.714 --> 00:49:31.509
Well, we were. I don't know exactly
what all that we're doing...

00:49:31.593 --> 00:49:35.596
- It is getting very, very late.
- Excuse me, I'm going to have to go.

00:49:35.681 --> 00:49:38.391
- Okay. Very nice.
- It's getting very, very late

00:49:38.475 --> 00:49:41.644
and it's time that, you know,

00:49:41.728 --> 00:49:45.314
we were ending
our dinner party and everything.

00:49:45.399 --> 00:49:48.317
- I apologize...
- But can't she come for desserts?

00:49:48.402 --> 00:49:50.903
Absolutely not, and neither can you.

00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:53.239
- The sheriff is on his way.
- I hope so.

00:49:53.323 --> 00:49:55.074
I've already called them.

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:58.202
Why you call police?
Have the retard escaped?

00:50:01.623 --> 00:50:05.209
I want say I very sorry
how they treat you in this house.

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:06.836
Thank you.

00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:10.589
I was thinking
maybe I'd just take the night off.

00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:12.842
Why don't we just go out
and have some fun?

00:50:12.926 --> 00:50:15.136
What do you think about that?

00:50:15.262 --> 00:50:17.388
You want to come with us?

00:50:17.472 --> 00:50:18.723
Up yours!

00:50:29.818 --> 00:50:31.736
Hi! My name Borat.

00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:34.280
- This my friend, Luenell.
- Hi, Luenell.

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:36.365
She is a prostitute.

00:50:54.801 --> 00:50:56.844
You were funny on that bull.

00:50:56.928 --> 00:50:59.889
Everybody almost see your underpants.

00:50:59.973 --> 00:51:02.099
I never rode a bull before.

00:51:06.146 --> 00:51:10.066
Well, you wanna...
You wanna come in for a little while?

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:13.235
I would like very much

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:16.405
but I in love with a woman in Malibu.

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:19.116
It would not be nice to her for me to...

00:51:19.201 --> 00:51:23.829
Okay, well, if you're ever in town again,
this way, you know, look me up.

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:27.208
If I ever in town again, Luenell,

00:51:27.292 --> 00:51:29.960
I would very much like to pay you for sex.

00:51:30.045 --> 00:51:31.170
Okay.

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:34.215
Good night, Luenells.

00:51:34.299 --> 00:51:35.966
Good night, Borat.

00:51:44.142 --> 00:51:47.186
You say my name right. Borat.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.980
People say Borak or Billy or Bob.

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:52.733
Bye.

00:52:04.412 --> 00:52:09.667
"Pamela is a fairly simple girl,
she recently explained.

00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:14.797
"'There's not a whole lot of logic
in the way I live my life.

00:52:14.881 --> 00:52:16.882
"'I am very spontaneous."'

00:52:17.884 --> 00:52:19.677
I'm very spontaneous too.

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:42.449
I needed a gift to give to Pamela

00:52:42.534 --> 00:52:45.911
so that she would grant me
entry into her vagina.

00:52:46.454 --> 00:52:51.876
Therefore, I convinced Azamat to let me
film a report in an American store.

00:52:53.628 --> 00:52:56.922
Don't spend more than $3.
We're low on money.

00:52:58.425 --> 00:53:00.676
This your shops?

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.803
Right, this is my antique shop.

00:53:02.888 --> 00:53:05.931
Why do you have
so many things with a flag?

00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:08.142
We're honoring our heritage.

00:53:08.518 --> 00:53:12.188
Now, what in here? What is this?

00:53:12.272 --> 00:53:14.148
These are a number of collectibles.

00:53:14.232 --> 00:53:17.902
I mean, this is a lamp that, you know,
you would use in your home.

00:53:17.986 --> 00:53:21.572
This is a Chinese cloisonn bell.

00:53:21.656 --> 00:53:25.576
And this is a little decorative duck.

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:28.746
And do you think, you know, when they...

00:53:32.959 --> 00:53:34.793
I'm sorry. Wait, wait, wait.

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:41.884
- We need help, baby.
- No, it's okay.

00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:46.472
I sorry.

00:53:50.685 --> 00:53:53.479
Sorry. I will repair all of this.

00:53:54.147 --> 00:53:58.734
Don't worry.
My friend, he can make glue and...

00:53:58.818 --> 00:54:02.238
I don't think you're gonna be able to glue
it. You're gonna have to pay for it.

00:54:02.322 --> 00:54:05.241
Okay, I have a digital watch
from the future.

00:54:05.325 --> 00:54:08.202
I will give you.
Is worth more than all of this.

00:54:08.286 --> 00:54:10.913
You broke $425 worth of stuff.

00:54:11.289 --> 00:54:14.875
160, 170, 180.

00:54:16.169 --> 00:54:18.879
- That's not enough.
- Do you want hair...

00:54:18.964 --> 00:54:20.756
No, I don't want any damn hair.

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.133
This is best hair in Kazakhstan.
Feel the quality.

00:54:23.218 --> 00:54:24.760
I don't want your damn hair.

00:54:24.844 --> 00:54:28.430
This is hair from pubis.
I can get 2,000 bags by next Friday.

00:54:28.515 --> 00:54:31.100
We don't use that stuff in this country.

00:54:31.393 --> 00:54:32.977
Have you offered them pubic hair?

00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:34.770
Yes!

00:54:34.854 --> 00:54:36.855
Just give me another 20.

00:54:37.274 --> 00:54:38.274
It was a mistake.

00:54:38.358 --> 00:54:39.566
You screwed up again.

00:54:39.651 --> 00:54:40.901
I didn't see the truck.

00:54:40.986 --> 00:54:43.112
- I slipped on it and that was it.
- Only an idiot could do this.

00:54:43.196 --> 00:54:47.449
Would you have believed this
if I had told you? All right. Go. Go. Go.

00:54:53.039 --> 00:54:55.541
You've ruined this documentary
and almost bankrupt us.

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:58.127
So call the ministry
and get more money.

00:54:58.211 --> 00:55:01.297
What? If I did that,
they would kill us!

00:55:02.048 --> 00:55:06.343
California had better be as good
as you say, or we're finished.

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:28.657
You bastard.

00:55:29.868 --> 00:55:31.160
What's the matter with you?

00:55:31.244 --> 00:55:34.413
How dare you make
hand-party over Pamela.

00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:37.041
Why do you care who I
pleasure myself to?

00:55:37.125 --> 00:55:39.043
Because I love this woman.

00:55:39.127 --> 00:55:42.296
She's the reason
we travel to California!

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.214
What?
You lied to me!

00:55:44.299 --> 00:55:46.175
You lied about California!

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:45.984
Eat my asshole!

00:57:18.351 --> 00:57:20.060
Holy...

00:57:21.229 --> 00:57:22.354
Okay.

00:57:47.547 --> 00:57:49.673
We have a special guest here this evening.
Ruth Feiner is here.

00:57:49.757 --> 00:57:51.258
MORTGAGE BROKERS
ANNUAL BANQUET

00:58:17.285 --> 00:58:19.328
Get the fuck out of here!

00:58:29.422 --> 00:58:32.049
So bad news.

00:58:33.092 --> 00:58:35.594
Azamat have leave.

00:58:37.096 --> 00:58:39.598
I wake up, he disappear

00:58:39.682 --> 00:58:44.436
and he take Oxana, my bear.

00:58:44.979 --> 00:58:46.271
Our bear.

00:58:47.273 --> 00:58:50.108
And he also decide to take all money

00:58:50.193 --> 00:58:52.444
and also my passport.

00:58:56.241 --> 00:59:01.370
And he leave me

00:59:01.454 --> 00:59:05.290
only this bag, with a hen

00:59:07.794 --> 00:59:14.299
and ticket to Kazakhstan.

00:59:15.552 --> 00:59:17.135
But no passport.

00:59:19.347 --> 00:59:23.016
But at least he is

00:59:23.101 --> 00:59:25.644
man enough to leave me

00:59:32.151 --> 00:59:33.777
my beautiful.

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:39.825
Which I have cleaned since last night.

00:59:43.329 --> 00:59:47.457
And I have decide to

00:59:47.542 --> 00:59:49.835
continue making documentary.

00:59:50.837 --> 00:59:53.589
Make it without Azamat.

00:59:53.673 --> 00:59:55.424
I think it will be better

00:59:55.508 --> 00:59:58.969
and we will have more success
without him.

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:38.175
I only want 17 cents, please.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:07.496
I had no car, no money and no Azamat.

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.539
The only thing keep me going

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:13.585
was my dream of one day
holding Pamela in my arms

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.963
and then making romance explosion
on her stomach.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:29.309
Eventually, I managed to hike a hitchings
with group of young scholars

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:31.645
also traveling across country.

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:34.690
FRATERNITY BROTHERS
Univ. of S. Carolina

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:38.026
- How you doing? How you doing?
- Where the fuck are you from, baby?

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:39.611
I am from Kazakhstan.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:42.656
- Welcome to fucking America!
- Hey, have a seat. Let's go.

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.367
- What's your name?
- Anthony.

01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:46.868
- Anthony?
- Yes.

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:48.704
- Anthony.
- And Justin.

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:51.707
- Justin.
- And David.

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.166
- David.
- Bartender Dave.

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:54.710
Very nice.

01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:57.379
- Can you open this, please?
- Oh, sure.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.675
Thank you very much.

01:02:01.759 --> 01:02:05.887
So you like the bitches out there
in the fucking old Russia, there?

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:07.723
- What?
- The bitches in old Russia.

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:09.474
How are the women?

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:12.686
The fucking ho's, baby! The fucking girls!

01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:14.563
- You fuck the shit out of them!
- Yes!

01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:16.022
Then you never call them again.

01:02:16.107 --> 01:02:19.818
Why you don't call them? Because
they do not have a telephone, yes?

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:21.361
No, not because of that.

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:24.030
They don't have my respect, you know?
I mean...

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:26.783
So, what are you doing here in America?

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:31.621
They film me travel across U.S. and A.

01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:35.208
I don't know what you're saying, man,
but that's cool!

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:36.918
Let's get drunk!

01:02:37.503 --> 01:02:39.296
- Yes! High five!
- High five!

01:02:43.634 --> 01:02:45.719
This is America in a bottle.

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:51.016
- Oh, baby!
- Oh, baby!

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.935
- Borat, let me hear it. Oh, baby!
- Oh, the baby!

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:56.021
Suck, suck, suck!

01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:03.612
Let me tell you game we play.

01:03:03.696 --> 01:03:05.280
Can I hear a game you play?

01:03:05.364 --> 01:03:09.075
We play a game called
"When the snake eat the pig."

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.162
- When the snake eat the huh?
- The snake eat the pig.

01:03:12.246 --> 01:03:15.540
- You get a baby mouse, very small...
- Baby mouse?

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:22.255
...and you put a bit of cheese
in hole of your chram, until it go inside.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:23.757
That is too crazy for me.

01:03:23.841 --> 01:03:26.593
I'll do it.
I don't give a fuck, I'll do it.

01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:28.887
Let me ask you this.

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:33.183
Are woman...
Are women your slaves in Russia?

01:03:33.726 --> 01:03:35.894
No. Do you have slaves here?

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:37.729
- We wish. We wish.
- No slaves.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:40.023
- It is a shame.
- Hey, Borat.

01:03:40.107 --> 01:03:41.191
Big shame. Big shame.

01:03:41.275 --> 01:03:42.776
It would be better country if...

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:45.695
Yes, it'd be better country.
We should have slaves.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:49.032
Our country, the minorities
actually have more power.

01:03:49.116 --> 01:03:53.703
Anyone that is minority
has the upper hand.

01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:58.041
We have the Jews. We have anybody
that's against the mainstream.

01:03:58.125 --> 01:04:01.002
- Do you want to see my new wife?
- Yes!

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:02.796
This my new wife.

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:05.882
- Pamela!
- You know her?

01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:07.592
Pamela! I know of Pamela.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:10.136
I will take her virgin for the first time.

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:12.973
- I am going to put this shit on.
- Put it on.

01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:15.225
Borat, Borat. We have a lot to talk about.

01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:17.435
I will take her virgin. I will uncork her.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.647
Borat, Borat. She is no virgin, Borat.

01:04:20.731 --> 01:04:22.732
- Is not true.
- She is no virgin, buddy.

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:26.152
Is not true. Liar!
Liar, liar, your panties on fire.

01:04:26.237 --> 01:04:27.779
Borat, shut up.

01:04:28.781 --> 01:04:31.992
Small Jacuzzi on a fucking small yacht.

01:04:32.076 --> 01:04:33.451
What she do?

01:04:34.453 --> 01:04:37.038
- She's sucking some dick, man.
- You see her sucking dick?

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:38.415
This is not her.

01:04:38.499 --> 01:04:42.544
I guarantee you that shit's gonna happen.
Don't worry about it.

01:04:42.628 --> 01:04:45.589
- That's her, Borat. Sorry.
- Borat, that's her.

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:47.173
This is not her.

01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:48.884
It's her. I'm sorry.

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:51.219
- I'm sure it's her.
- I go.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:53.221
- No, no, no.
- Titty bar.

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:55.098
Come here.

01:04:55.182 --> 01:04:56.933
You're my man. You're my man.

01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:59.686
I do not know why she is trying to do this.

01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:01.605
Come on, Borat. Stay with us, buddy.

01:05:01.689 --> 01:05:05.275
We love you. We'll remember you always.
Like I taught you.

01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:08.028
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

01:05:08.112 --> 01:05:10.655

01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:06.261
I will go to Malibu with me
and my friend, Mr. Jesus

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:08.179

01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:19.148
I took a bus to Los Angeles
with some friends of Mr. Jesus.

01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:21.693

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:58.980
Calm down.
Let me explain.

01:11:59.064 --> 01:12:00.690
What did you do with the bear?

01:12:00.774 --> 01:12:03.401
She ran off. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:05.903
Hey! Fuck off, Death!

01:12:06.071 --> 01:12:07.655
You need to calm yourself!

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.407
You have to calm down!

01:12:13.412 --> 01:12:16.706
Well, that's another fine
mess you've gotten me into.

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:23.838
I had not come to Hollywood
to fight a man dressed as Hitler.

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:28.259
l had come to make
Pamela Andersons my wife.

01:12:29.261 --> 01:12:31.054
So I forgave Azamat.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:35.099
I knew you'd make it here, Borat.

01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:38.853
I felt so bad that I prepare this for you.

01:12:41.607 --> 01:12:44.942
It's everything I could find on Pamela.

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:51.783
Last Friday she appeared for a group
who are against cruelty to animals.

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:54.118
Against cruelty to animals?

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:04.379
And tomorrow she's doing a signing.

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:06.798
She wrote a book.

01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:12.595
What? A woman has written a book?

01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:15.598
Dr. Yamak would never believe this.

01:13:15.682 --> 01:13:16.724
I know.

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:21.938

01:13:22.022 --> 01:13:23.815

01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:27.235

01:16:53.191 --> 01:16:55.943
It was time for me to return to New York,

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:59.530
where a ticket was waiting for me
to fly back home.

01:17:00.365 --> 01:17:05.536

01:17:24.681 --> 01:17:26.724
Suddenly, I realized.

01:17:30.228 --> 01:17:33.731
I had learned that if you chase a dream,

01:17:33.815 --> 01:17:36.901
especially one with plastic chests,

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:40.780
you can miss the real beauty
in front of your eyes.

01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:47.828
