00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.164
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:05:16.964 --> 00:05:19.635
It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you.

00:05:19.927 --> 00:05:21.089
What do you want?

00:05:21.178 --> 00:05:22.043
I thought you were...

00:05:22.137 --> 00:05:23.217
What?

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:25.513
I don't know.

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:39.942
Help! Help!

00:05:43.326 --> 00:05:45.484
Help! Help!

00:05:49.207 --> 00:05:50.286
Stop!

00:05:56.507 --> 00:06:00.587
- What? What?
- It's okay. Come here.

00:06:20.824 --> 00:06:23.825
It's okay. Calm down.
Everything's gonna be fine.

00:06:23.994 --> 00:06:25.156
What was in there?

00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:27.280
Just gimme a minute
to figure things out.

00:06:27.373 --> 00:06:30.375
- Why were you afraid of that room?
- Gimme a minute I said.

00:06:36.048 --> 00:06:38.172
How many people are in this thing?

00:06:40.636 --> 00:06:43.591
Listen. We can't go
climbing around in here.

00:06:43.848 --> 00:06:44.964
Why not?

00:06:46.894 --> 00:06:49.432
- There are traps.
- What do you mean traps?

00:06:49.564 --> 00:06:52.730
Booby traps. I looked
into a room down there and

00:06:52.816 --> 00:06:54.560
something almost cut my head off.

00:06:58.947 --> 00:07:03.444
Holy cats. Holy, holy cats.

00:07:22.722 --> 00:07:25.559
You alright? Mister?

00:07:28.313 --> 00:07:29.095
Worth!

00:07:34.445 --> 00:07:35.227
Don't worry.

00:07:41.576 --> 00:07:42.491
I hit my head.

00:07:42.828 --> 00:07:47.407
Let me take a look at that.
I'm a doctor. It doesn't look that bad.

00:07:51.462 --> 00:07:53.006
What the hell are you doing?

00:08:06.395 --> 00:08:09.016
Hey, old man,
did you hear what I said?

00:08:29.877 --> 00:08:34.007
Motion detectors. Integrated
into the walls. Tough to spot.

00:08:35.718 --> 00:08:38.802
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

00:08:42.267 --> 00:08:45.601
Wait a second.
Let's all just relax for a minute.

00:08:47.813 --> 00:08:49.807
Does anybody remember
how they got here?

00:08:57.992 --> 00:08:59.023
Perogies.

00:09:02.914 --> 00:09:04.112
I was eating dinner.

00:09:04.665 --> 00:09:05.947
Perogies. Cheese and potatoes.

00:09:06.043 --> 00:09:08.711
I ran out of sour cream and then
I went to the fridge and then...

00:09:09.796 --> 00:09:10.661
I don't know.

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:14.545
You? Leaven?

00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:19.713
I, I just went to bed and...

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:23.591
What about you?

00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:27.349
I just woke up here.

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:28.812
Middle of the night.

00:09:29.609 --> 00:09:32.146
It's like Chile. They always come
in the middle of the night.

00:09:33.237 --> 00:09:34.103
Who?

00:09:34.196 --> 00:09:36.770
Only the goverment could build
something this ugly.

00:09:36.866 --> 00:09:37.981
It ain't government.

00:09:38.076 --> 00:09:40.448
- Then what is it?
- I don't know.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.076
Aliens.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.877
Please.
We're spooked enough as it is.

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:54.672
Let's rule out aliens for now and
concentrate on what we know.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.958
My mom's gonna freak.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.504
Rennes?

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:02.131
- I just won't be there. They'll freak.
- What do you think, Rennes?

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.308
We won't solve jack shit sittin' still.

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:07.889
I'm moving in a straight line
'till I get to the end.

00:10:08.484 --> 00:10:10.026
All right, I tend to agree.

00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:12.775
- Shouldn't we wait here?
- For what?

00:10:13.197 --> 00:10:14.691
To see if anybody comes.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.234
No one is gonna come.

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:20.277
Look. There is a way in here,
so there's gotta be a way out.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.906
We can avoid
the traps using the boot.

00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:26.910
Holloway is it?
What do you think? Look for an exit?

00:10:27.671 --> 00:10:28.501
Okay.

00:10:29.548 --> 00:10:30.662
What about you?

00:10:30.924 --> 00:10:34.258
- It can't be that simple.
- It won't be that simple.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.386
Look around.
Take a good long looksee.

00:10:40.225 --> 00:10:42.514
'Cause I got a feeling
it's looking at us.

00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:52.320
I just want to wake up.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.117
Leaven. We can do this.

00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:05.912
We just have to stay calm
and work together as a team.

00:11:07.672 --> 00:11:10.458
There's gonna be a lot of people
looking for us on the outside.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:11.999
I'm a cop.

00:11:12.801 --> 00:11:13.751
All right?

00:11:15.263 --> 00:11:16.842
- You're a cop?
- Yeah.

00:11:17.975 --> 00:11:20.134
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise.

00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:22.763
You gotta be with me on this one.

00:11:28.026 --> 00:11:28.809
Okay.

00:11:40.707 --> 00:11:41.739
Boot it!

00:11:49.758 --> 00:11:50.623
Clean.

00:12:10.572 --> 00:12:12.067
That one sounded closer.

00:12:12.657 --> 00:12:15.280
It's mechanical. It seems
to come at regular intervals.

00:12:15.661 --> 00:12:17.534
Maybe it's the ventilation system.

00:12:17.747 --> 00:12:20.416
- No vents.
- No kidding, I'm boiling.

00:12:24.045 --> 00:12:24.959
What is it?

00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:29.539
Serial numbers?

00:12:29.885 --> 00:12:32.636
Room numbers.
They're different in each room.

00:12:33.137 --> 00:12:37.218
Oh great. There are only 566 millions
400 thousand rooms in this thing.

00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:38.637
Well, there better not be?

00:12:38.727 --> 00:12:40.850
We have about 3 days
without food and water

00:12:40.937 --> 00:12:42.931
before we are too weak to move.

00:12:43.274 --> 00:12:44.982
Well, they have to feed us,
don't they?

00:12:46.403 --> 00:12:47.481
Holloway.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:52.695
Oh, we have heat, stress, physical
exsection, i.e., dehydratation,

00:12:52.784 --> 00:12:56.153
headaches, dizziness, disorientation,
confused mental processes.

00:12:56.246 --> 00:12:59.163
The body eventually begins
to break down its own tissue.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.288
Suck on it.

00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:08.006
Keeps the saliva flowing.

00:13:26.445 --> 00:13:28.733
- What?
- The air seems dry in there.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.980
Trapped?

00:13:30.283 --> 00:13:32.192
Molecular chemical sensor.

00:13:32.327 --> 00:13:34.366
Why the hell didn't
the boot set it off?

00:13:34.537 --> 00:13:35.782
The boot's not alive.

00:13:36.372 --> 00:13:39.326
Detects hydrogen sulphide
excreted from the skin.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.992
How is it you know
so much about sensors, Renz?

00:13:47.216 --> 00:13:51.714
Renn. Not Renz. It's French.

00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:53.965
Fine, you're French.
I'm asking how you...

00:13:57.019 --> 00:14:00.020
Renn. Sensor expert,

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:01.303
about the right age.

00:14:02.149 --> 00:14:03.430
I don't believe it.

00:14:07.113 --> 00:14:09.687
- This guy is the Wren.
- The what?

00:14:09.991 --> 00:14:14.072
He's the Wren. The Bird of Attica.
Flew the coop on 6 major prisons.

00:14:14.579 --> 00:14:15.611
Seven.

00:14:15.747 --> 00:14:17.540
You're kidding, right?

00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:19.704
You can get us out.

00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:20.914
Maybe.

00:14:21.504 --> 00:14:23.127
An escape artist.

00:14:23.213 --> 00:14:25.122
Yeah, I'm Harry fucking Houdini.

00:14:27.427 --> 00:14:29.965
The only reason I dragged you
this far is 'cause I need your boots.

00:14:30.722 --> 00:14:33.213
If you don't smarten up,
I'll be gone like that.

00:14:34.601 --> 00:14:35.881
No more talking.

00:14:37.104 --> 00:14:38.384
No more guessing.

00:14:39.356 --> 00:14:42.642
Don't even think about nothing
that's not right in front of you.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.233
That's the real challenge.

00:14:46.614 --> 00:14:49.187
You got to save yourselves
from yourselves.

00:14:59.169 --> 00:15:00.082
Merde.

00:15:10.054 --> 00:15:11.384
Get him out!

00:15:46.095 --> 00:15:47.340
Oh my god!

00:15:55.562 --> 00:16:00.390
So, it was electro chemical or
whatever, right? And he missed it.

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:04.728
The Wren. That's great!
That's fuckin' great!

00:16:17.294 --> 00:16:20.912
All right. It's time
to reassess this place.

00:16:21.172 --> 00:16:23.499
I've been over it again and again.

00:16:23.634 --> 00:16:25.710
Why would they throw
innocent people in here?

00:16:25.803 --> 00:16:27.262
Are we being punished?

00:16:28.181 --> 00:16:30.672
I've never done anything
to deserve this.

00:16:31.141 --> 00:16:32.340
Forget about all that!

00:16:33.645 --> 00:16:36.397
You can't see the big picture
from in here, so don't try.

00:16:36.648 --> 00:16:38.272
Keep your head down.
Keep it simple.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.599
Just look at what's in front of you.

00:16:40.693 --> 00:16:41.807
That's what he said.

00:16:42.446 --> 00:16:46.574
Start with us.
We got an escape artist and a cop.

00:16:46.825 --> 00:16:47.987
There's gotta be a reason for that.

00:16:48.744 --> 00:16:52.612
You're doctor, Holloway. It gives you
a function, a reason, right?

00:16:53.375 --> 00:16:54.916
No. It's just makes me go why me

00:16:55.001 --> 00:16:58.038
and why not one of the other
10 million doctors out there.

00:17:04.802 --> 00:17:06.630
Leaven, what are you?

00:17:07.013 --> 00:17:13.266
Nothing. I just go to school.
I hang out with my friends.

00:17:13.353 --> 00:17:15.845
- What else?
- There's nothing else.

00:17:16.899 --> 00:17:20.685
My parents are these people.
I live with them. I'm boring.

00:17:21.071 --> 00:17:24.818
I think we have to ask
the big questions.

00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:26.324
What does it want?

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.159
What is it thinking?

00:17:28.952 --> 00:17:30.579
One down, four to go.

00:17:35.377 --> 00:17:37.619
Why don't you tell us
what your purpose is, Worth?

00:17:37.838 --> 00:17:39.415
Often wondered that myself.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.501
I'm just a guy.

00:17:46.888 --> 00:17:49.891
I work in an office building,
doing office building stuff.

00:17:50.434 --> 00:17:55.143
I wasn't exactly bursting with
"joie de vivre" before I got here.

00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:56.856
Life just sucks in general.

00:17:57.025 --> 00:18:00.395
- I can't stand that attitude.
- Because he's right.

00:18:01.155 --> 00:18:03.361
What's your purpose, Quentin?

00:18:08.411 --> 00:18:10.986
Kids, three of them.

00:18:12.542 --> 00:18:14.000
I haven't made my peace yet.

00:18:16.045 --> 00:18:18.037
I'm getting out of here,
no matter what.

00:18:18.215 --> 00:18:20.172
That's where
my strength comes from.

00:18:20.843 --> 00:18:22.751
You, people,
find yours wherever you got it.

00:18:24.221 --> 00:18:26.178
For Christ's sake, Worth.
What do you live for?

00:18:26.264 --> 00:18:28.507
Don't you have a wife or
a girlfriend, or something?

00:18:28.726 --> 00:18:31.014
No. I've got a pretty fine
collection of pornography.

00:18:31.604 --> 00:18:33.810
Oh, nice, nice.

00:18:35.607 --> 00:18:39.226
I haven't got anybody either, but
I'm not giving up! I am pissed off.

00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:40.905
They came into our homes!

00:18:41.239 --> 00:18:45.486
They stripped us bare.
They took my rings, they took...

00:18:46.369 --> 00:18:48.410
...oh, my amethyst.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.993
I wanna know who's responsible.

00:18:55.086 --> 00:18:57.578
Leaven. Your glasses?

00:18:59.925 --> 00:19:00.956
You don't need them?

00:19:01.927 --> 00:19:03.042
They're for reading.

00:19:05.639 --> 00:19:09.769
Well they took off our jewelry,
but why they put these on you.

00:19:11.271 --> 00:19:12.386
If nothing is random,

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.519
why are they here?

00:19:21.281 --> 00:19:26.193
Leaven. What do you do
in school? Math?

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.658
What can they mean?

00:19:43.472 --> 00:19:44.752
149.

00:20:00.698 --> 00:20:04.399
Prime numbers. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:05.491
See what?

00:20:05.787 --> 00:20:08.326
It seems like, if any
of these numbers are prime,

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:09.488
then the room's trapped.

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:16.997
645, 645... That's not prime.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.292
372... no.

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:24.047
649...

00:20:25.142 --> 00:20:27.633
Well, 11 times 59.
It's not prime either.

00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:31.599
So that room is safe.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:33.056
Wait.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.401
How can you make that assumption
based on one prime number trap?

00:20:36.487 --> 00:20:40.651
I'm not. The incinerator thing
was prime 083.

00:20:41.325 --> 00:20:44.825
The molecular chemical thing had
137. The acid room had 149.

00:20:44.996 --> 00:20:46.276
You remember all that in your head?

00:20:46.497 --> 00:20:47.825
I have a facility for it.

00:20:48.666 --> 00:20:53.376
Leaven, you beautiful brain.

00:20:54.965 --> 00:20:55.712
Boot it.

00:21:00.054 --> 00:21:01.334
Okay, out of the way.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.092
Brains before beauty.

00:21:09.522 --> 00:21:11.895
Safe, safe.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.276
Prime numbers! Prime numbers!

00:21:26.249 --> 00:21:28.536
Oh, how long have we been in here?

00:21:30.752 --> 00:21:32.033
Nine or ten hours.

00:21:34.632 --> 00:21:35.545
How do you know?

00:21:37.343 --> 00:21:41.757
Five o'clock shadow. Last thing
I remember was shaving.

00:21:43.517 --> 00:21:46.352
I guess
I missed breakfast or lunch...

00:21:47.021 --> 00:21:48.219
or whatever.

00:21:50.608 --> 00:21:53.312
Don't worry.
I'll be home in time for dinner.

00:21:56.239 --> 00:21:58.527
If we get out, I'll make you dinner.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.940
You got a date.

00:22:20.931 --> 00:22:21.927
Doin' good.

00:22:36.697 --> 00:22:40.150
I need to smoke.
I'd smoke a butt off a sidewalk.

00:22:40.828 --> 00:22:44.162
Holloway.
Just reel yourself in a bit. Come on.

00:22:44.457 --> 00:22:46.116
We're moving along.
Things are looking up.

00:22:46.291 --> 00:22:49.459
Ok, ok. You are right.
I quit smoking years ago.

00:22:51.298 --> 00:22:52.626
I just need to be occupied.

00:22:53.008 --> 00:22:56.377
Talk then. Have a conversation.
What kind of doctor are you anyway?

00:22:57.053 --> 00:22:58.797
Oh, you know, the free kind.

00:23:03.101 --> 00:23:05.593
Come on. Help me.
Tell me about your rug rats.

00:23:07.105 --> 00:23:11.104
We have three boys. 9, 7 and 5.

00:23:11.695 --> 00:23:15.526
Good God. Poor woman.
There's no way I'd survive that.

00:23:17.409 --> 00:23:18.524
She didn't either.

00:23:21.204 --> 00:23:23.492
She's not dead,
we're just separated.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.455
I'm sorry.
I can't just shoot the breeze.

00:23:30.422 --> 00:23:31.833
These numbers aren't prime.

00:23:31.923 --> 00:23:33.667
Okay, clear.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:39.718
Excuse me, sorry.

00:23:45.521 --> 00:23:48.357
You, could try and
help me out here, buddy.

00:23:48.859 --> 00:23:49.938
No, I couldn't.

00:23:59.411 --> 00:24:01.072
This one's trapped too.

00:24:07.128 --> 00:24:08.670
We have to backtrack?

00:24:12.341 --> 00:24:13.421
Not yet.

00:24:20.226 --> 00:24:21.257
Read them to me.

00:24:35.116 --> 00:24:38.283
- What are you, his coat rack?
- Oh, please!

00:24:49.799 --> 00:24:50.829
It's stuck.

00:24:53.845 --> 00:24:54.592
Look out.

00:25:02.687 --> 00:25:04.146
This room is green.

00:25:09.737 --> 00:25:10.816
Holloway?

00:25:18.955 --> 00:25:19.785
Hi there.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.121
This room is green.

00:25:26.796 --> 00:25:27.710
Yes, it is.

00:25:30.008 --> 00:25:31.967
I wanna go back to the blue room.

00:25:33.638 --> 00:25:34.965
What is it? Shock or what?

00:25:35.556 --> 00:25:37.299
I think he's mentally handicapped.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.475
I like the blue room.

00:25:40.894 --> 00:25:44.394
- Jesus Christ.
- He almost broke my neck.

00:25:45.108 --> 00:25:49.022
Hey there, are you all alone?
You want to hold my hand, honey?

00:25:49.988 --> 00:25:53.440
Butter first, then honey, Kazan.
Butter first, then honey...

00:25:53.576 --> 00:25:57.786
- How'd he survive?
- I want to go back to the blue room.

00:25:58.163 --> 00:26:00.869
There's lots of blue rooms.
We'll find you another real soon.

00:26:02.293 --> 00:26:03.668
This is just way too bizarre.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.877
Well, you just worry
about your numbers then.

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:11.092
Go on. I'll look after him.

00:26:15.057 --> 00:26:18.508
Safe. Obviously,
since he almost fell on my head.

00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:21.935
Should we go for a walk, Kazan?

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:24.179
You want to go for a walk?

00:26:38.581 --> 00:26:40.824
Let's not make him do
the climbing thing right away.

00:26:41.043 --> 00:26:41.908
Holloway...

00:26:43.044 --> 00:26:44.075
Hol-Io-way.

00:26:49.259 --> 00:26:51.667
Could they have taken us
all the way to New Mexico?

00:26:51.804 --> 00:26:53.263
What are you
talking about, Holloway?

00:26:54.724 --> 00:26:57.262
I'm talking about where do you
hide something this big.

00:26:57.977 --> 00:26:59.556
At least he's good for something.

00:27:03.817 --> 00:27:05.476
I'm sorry to shake
your foundations, Quentin,

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.982
but you have no idea
where your tax dollars go.

00:27:08.696 --> 00:27:10.357
Free clinic doctors?

00:27:11.074 --> 00:27:13.446
Only the military
industrial complex could afford

00:27:13.536 --> 00:27:15.243
to build something this size.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:18.990
Holloway, what is
the military industrial complex?

00:27:19.083 --> 00:27:20.458
Have you ever been there?

00:27:20.543 --> 00:27:22.086
I'm telling you,
it's not that complex.

00:27:22.212 --> 00:27:23.919
How would you know
from where you are?

00:27:25.006 --> 00:27:27.081
Who do you think
the establishment is?

00:27:27.174 --> 00:27:28.455
It's just guys like me.

00:27:28.843 --> 00:27:31.085
Their desks are bigger,
but their jobs are't.

00:27:31.179 --> 00:27:33.136
They don't conspire...
they buy boats.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.844
No, this place is...
remember Scaramanga?

00:27:37.728 --> 00:27:39.720
The bad guy in
"The Man With The Golden Gun".

00:27:42.066 --> 00:27:44.354
It's some rich
psycho's entertainment.

00:27:47.406 --> 00:27:48.568
Is that what you think?

00:27:49.657 --> 00:27:50.487
Clear.

00:28:01.504 --> 00:28:03.496
Ok. You are a cop.

00:28:04.673 --> 00:28:07.675
Single bullet theory. Right on.

00:28:18.104 --> 00:28:20.774
- Gas!
- Holloway, get back here!

00:28:25.613 --> 00:28:29.029
It's okay.
I just swallowed my button.

00:28:33.913 --> 00:28:35.455
I hate this. I hate this.

00:28:40.503 --> 00:28:42.709
Your boy is having
a conniption fit in there.

00:28:47.219 --> 00:28:49.294
It's like cramming without coffee.

00:28:49.638 --> 00:28:51.511
- She needs a break.
- She can do it.

00:29:01.484 --> 00:29:02.859
They don't look like prime to me.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.603
Is that your two bits worth, Worth?

00:29:06.615 --> 00:29:08.108
For what it's worth.

00:29:13.498 --> 00:29:18.705
- Well?
- Well, he's right. Not prime.

00:29:23.382 --> 00:29:26.217
Stop! In front of you!

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.813
What is it?

00:29:51.036 --> 00:29:52.200
Shut up!

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.288
I don't know what happened.
It wasn't prime.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:02.291
Quentin, hold still.

00:30:05.135 --> 00:30:09.464
- Somebody stops that racket.
- Worth!

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.805
Leave the boots.

00:30:23.572 --> 00:30:25.481
And shut the fucking door!

00:30:29.535 --> 00:30:31.695
I had a feeling
about that fucking guy.

00:30:32.498 --> 00:30:34.040
He knew about that trap.

00:30:34.583 --> 00:30:35.911
These numbers aren't prime.

00:30:36.002 --> 00:30:37.745
Then your number system failed,
but he knew...

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.580
Knew what? How would he know?

00:30:39.714 --> 00:30:41.292
You are the paranoid one,
think about it.

00:30:41.383 --> 00:30:43.956
His only function so far has been
to kick us when we're down.

00:30:44.052 --> 00:30:46.970
So he has a bad attitude. Are you
saying, that makes him a spy?

00:30:47.139 --> 00:30:49.760
Trust me on this. It's my job
to read people like an X-Ray.

00:30:55.355 --> 00:30:56.636
He doesn't like red rooms.

00:31:05.283 --> 00:31:06.314
So what happened?

00:31:07.285 --> 00:31:09.408
- You saw what happened.
- Quentin!

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.655
I guess the numbers are
more complicated that I thought.

00:31:12.207 --> 00:31:13.369
Maybe they mean nothing at all.

00:31:13.708 --> 00:31:15.451
No. It means
they are more involved.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.668
They've worked for us up 'till now,
haven't they?

00:31:17.753 --> 00:31:19.463
I just need more time with them.

00:31:19.756 --> 00:31:21.998
Well, we need to rest anyway.

00:31:22.802 --> 00:31:26.051
Well. That's handy. 'Cause there's
not a fuck of a lot else we can do.

00:31:39.194 --> 00:31:41.103
Are they telling you anything?

00:31:42.239 --> 00:31:43.649
They're not tarot cards.

00:31:45.951 --> 00:31:48.703
Do you have any idea how many
variables I have to consider

00:31:48.787 --> 00:31:51.410
before I can
decipher numbers this size?

00:31:52.249 --> 00:31:54.159
They don't reveal
themselves right away.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.533
They're like people.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.004
Oh, gross.

00:32:08.309 --> 00:32:11.262
Oh, not here honey.
Over in the corner.

00:32:18.444 --> 00:32:20.152
Well, he's just peeing.

00:32:21.238 --> 00:32:22.733
Jesus Christ.

00:32:23.532 --> 00:32:26.321
That's excellent.
Now it totally reeks in here!

00:32:28.747 --> 00:32:30.490
You find this all
pretty funny, don't you?

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.039
What's your
fucking problem, Worth?

00:32:39.759 --> 00:32:41.716
Even Holloway's
holding up better than you.

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:46.509
Get over there and help her with him.
That's your job. Babysitter.

00:32:48.851 --> 00:32:50.394
Jawohl, Kommandant.

00:32:53.356 --> 00:32:55.682
Somebody has to take
responsability around here.

00:32:56.318 --> 00:32:58.441
And that somebody has to be you.

00:32:58.696 --> 00:33:00.569
Not all of us have
the luxury of playing nihilist.

00:33:01.073 --> 00:33:03.907
Not all of us are
conceited enough to play hero.

00:33:05.911 --> 00:33:07.654
This is a will to live.

00:33:07.871 --> 00:33:09.496
Everybody's got it,
Worth, even you.

00:33:09.623 --> 00:33:11.949
Especially you,
hiding behind that cynical front.

00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:13.497
A will to live.

00:33:13.961 --> 00:33:16.536
That's the warm,
cosy feeling deep inside.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:19.048
Thanks Quentin, I'm a new man.

00:33:19.301 --> 00:33:22.752
Oh, poor Worth. Nobody loves me.

00:33:23.221 --> 00:33:24.681
If that's the chip
on your shoulder, why

00:33:24.807 --> 00:33:25.885
did you lug it all this way?

00:33:26.183 --> 00:33:27.760
Why didn't you
just lie down and die?

00:33:41.783 --> 00:33:42.814
Do it.

00:33:43.327 --> 00:33:46.078
Show us you have some backbone
and jump in the sushi machine.

00:33:46.455 --> 00:33:47.618
Be a man.

00:33:57.175 --> 00:33:58.373
Thought so.

00:34:01.137 --> 00:34:02.596
Fuck you Quentin!

00:34:05.225 --> 00:34:07.680
I don't wanna die.
I'm just being realistic.

00:34:07.769 --> 00:34:09.596
Do you think they'd go to all
the trouble to build this thing

00:34:09.688 --> 00:34:10.802
if we could just walk out?

00:34:10.896 --> 00:34:12.060
Do you think
they would have left us clues

00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:14.188
and let us beat it so far
if there wasn't a way out?

00:34:14.276 --> 00:34:15.556
You think we matter? We don't.

00:34:15.652 --> 00:34:18.321
Put us out of your misery so we can
get on with getting out of here.

00:34:18.405 --> 00:34:19.780
You're not getting out of here!

00:34:19.864 --> 00:34:21.407
- Yes, we are!
- No, you're not!

00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:24.576
- Yes, we are!
- There is no way out of here!

00:34:40.177 --> 00:34:41.377
Gotchya.

00:34:47.645 --> 00:34:51.430
How do you know that?

00:34:54.027 --> 00:34:55.520
Answer the question, Worth.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:59.772
Oh, god.

00:35:04.663 --> 00:35:05.826
Who are you?

00:35:17.218 --> 00:35:18.676
I'm the poison.

00:35:21.223 --> 00:35:22.764
I designed the outer shell.

00:35:23.683 --> 00:35:24.763
The what?

00:35:25.936 --> 00:35:27.844
The shell. The sarcophagus.

00:35:29.189 --> 00:35:30.684
You built this thing?

00:35:30.775 --> 00:35:32.055
Not this part. The exterior.

00:35:32.193 --> 00:35:34.944
I don't know anything about the
numbers or anything else in here.

00:35:35.946 --> 00:35:39.612
I was contracted to draw
plans for a hollow shell.

00:35:41.118 --> 00:35:42.233
A cube.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.990
A cube? Why didn't you tell us?

00:35:47.082 --> 00:35:50.120
For God's sake, Worth,
you knew what it was.

00:35:52.046 --> 00:35:53.209
No.

00:35:54.132 --> 00:35:56.968
Worth. You're lying.

00:36:01.015 --> 00:36:02.426
Was not at first.

00:36:03.308 --> 00:36:04.589
Who's behind it?

00:36:08.648 --> 00:36:09.644
I don't know.

00:36:10.358 --> 00:36:11.734
Who hired you?

00:36:13.694 --> 00:36:14.726
I didn't ask.

00:36:17.114 --> 00:36:18.776
I never even left my office.

00:36:19.576 --> 00:36:21.902
I talked on the phone to some
people, other guys like me.

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:24.155
Specialists,
working on small details.

00:36:24.331 --> 00:36:25.610
Nobody knew what it was.

00:36:26.332 --> 00:36:27.448
Nobody cared.

00:36:27.668 --> 00:36:30.373
Bullshit.
You knew from square one.

00:36:31.255 --> 00:36:34.340
Look at him. He is up
to his eyeballs in this thing.

00:36:34.467 --> 00:36:37.718
No, Quentin.
That's how they stay hidden.

00:36:38.263 --> 00:36:39.378
You keep everyone separated

00:36:39.473 --> 00:36:41.928
so the left hand doesn't know
what the right hand is doing.

00:36:42.058 --> 00:36:44.217
The brain
never comes out in the open.

00:36:45.187 --> 00:36:46.267
Whose brain?

00:36:47.814 --> 00:36:50.056
It's all the same machine, right!

00:36:50.192 --> 00:36:53.976
The Pentagone, multinational
corporations, the police.

00:36:54.613 --> 00:36:58.446
If you do one little job,
you build a widget in Saskatoon,

00:36:58.576 --> 00:37:00.949
and the next thing you know
it's two miles under

00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:04.246
the desert, the essential
component of a death machine.

00:37:04.957 --> 00:37:07.877
I was right.
All along, my whole life,

00:37:08.004 --> 00:37:10.291
I knew it. I told you, Quentin.

00:37:10.422 --> 00:37:12.877
Nobody's every gonna
call me paranoid again.

00:37:13.049 --> 00:37:15.967
We gotta get out of here and
blow the lid of this thing!

00:37:22.351 --> 00:37:24.428
Holloway, you don't get it.

00:37:25.272 --> 00:37:27.679
Then help me,
please, I need to know.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:30.859
This may be hard
for you to understand,

00:37:30.944 --> 00:37:32.686
but there's no conspiracy.

00:37:33.154 --> 00:37:34.613
Nobody is in charge.

00:37:35.156 --> 00:37:39.653
It's a headless blunder operating
under the illusion of a master plan.

00:37:39.995 --> 00:37:41.109
Can you grasp that?

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.656
Big brother is not watching you.

00:37:46.128 --> 00:37:48.119
What kind of
fuckin' explanation is that?

00:37:48.254 --> 00:37:49.499
It's the best you are gonna get.

00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:51.416
I looked, and the only conclusion
I could come to is that

00:37:51.591 --> 00:37:53.001
there is nobody up there.

00:37:53.135 --> 00:37:55.257
Somebody had to say
yes to this thing.

00:37:55.344 --> 00:37:57.254
What thing?
Only we know what it is.

00:37:57.347 --> 00:38:00.467
- We have no idea what it is.
- We know more than anybody else.

00:38:00.892 --> 00:38:02.932
I mean, somebody might have
known sometime before they go,

00:38:03.019 --> 00:38:05.558
they got fired, or
voted out, or sold it,

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:07.565
but if this place
ever had a purpose,

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.141
and it got miscommunicated,
or lost in a shuffle.

00:38:10.486 --> 00:38:11.814
I mean, this is and accident,

00:38:11.904 --> 00:38:15.321
a forgotten perpetual
public works project.

00:38:15.575 --> 00:38:17.235
Do you think anybody
wants to ask questions?

00:38:17.493 --> 00:38:19.616
All they want is
a clear conscience,

00:38:19.746 --> 00:38:20.991
and a fat paycheck.

00:38:21.372 --> 00:38:23.081
I leaned on my shovel
for months on this one.

00:38:23.209 --> 00:38:24.584
This was a great job!

00:38:27.004 --> 00:38:28.546
Why put people in it?

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:33.635
Because it's here. You have
to use it or you admit it's pointless.

00:38:33.761 --> 00:38:35.920
But it is pointless.

00:38:37.641 --> 00:38:39.596
Quentin. That's my point.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.769
What have we come to?

00:38:44.314 --> 00:38:46.472
It's so much worse than I thought.

00:38:47.692 --> 00:38:50.527
Not really. Just more pathetic.

00:38:51.488 --> 00:38:53.612
You make me sick, Worth.

00:38:54.033 --> 00:38:55.741
I make me sick too.

00:38:56.619 --> 00:38:58.113
We're both part of the system.

00:38:58.704 --> 00:39:02.203
I drew a box, you walk a beat.
It's like you said, Quentin,

00:39:02.333 --> 00:39:04.207
is keep your head down,
keep it simple,

00:39:04.335 --> 00:39:05.746
just look at what's in front of you.

00:39:05.878 --> 00:39:07.670
I mean, nobody wants to see
the big picture.

00:39:07.922 --> 00:39:09.202
Life's too complicated.

00:39:10.008 --> 00:39:15.050
I mean, let's face it, the reason
we're here is that it's out of control.

00:39:27.651 --> 00:39:29.644
This is how we ruin the world?

00:39:30.364 --> 00:39:34.740
Well, have you been on glue
all your lives?

00:39:35.368 --> 00:39:38.903
I've felt guilty for ruining
the world since I was like 7.

00:39:39.958 --> 00:39:43.576
God, if you need someone
to blame, throw a rock.

00:39:50.843 --> 00:39:52.006
Well, I feel better.

00:39:53.387 --> 00:39:55.012
That's why you stayed with us.

00:39:56.432 --> 00:39:57.713
To confess.

00:40:12.408 --> 00:40:15.029
You still looking
for someone to bust, Quentin?

00:40:25.129 --> 00:40:27.122
Quentin! Stop it! Stop it!

00:40:28.927 --> 00:40:30.125
We need him.

00:40:32.679 --> 00:40:33.675
What for?

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:35.887
Have you gone absolutely mad?

00:40:36.015 --> 00:40:38.424
He's the only one who knows
anything about the place.

00:40:50.741 --> 00:40:53.741
- Worth.
- Hi.

00:40:54.535 --> 00:40:57.490
- So there's this outer shell.
- Yeah.

00:40:57.665 --> 00:41:01.532
- And it's a cube, right? Like this.
- I assume so.

00:41:01.752 --> 00:41:04.457
- Are there any doors?
- There's one door.

00:41:04.546 --> 00:41:06.955
- Where?
- Wherever the door guy put it.

00:41:07.592 --> 00:41:10.214
Six guesses, and
it's sealed from the outside.

00:41:11.221 --> 00:41:14.257
And, what are the dimensions
of the outer shell?

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.302
434 square feet.

00:41:28.156 --> 00:41:29.235
May I?

00:41:29.323 --> 00:41:31.198
Come on, honey, slide over.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.328
14 by 14 by 14.

00:41:39.584 --> 00:41:42.668
The inner cube can't be flush
with the shell wall, there's a space.

00:41:43.379 --> 00:41:44.292
One cube?

00:41:44.672 --> 00:41:46.084
I don't know, it makes sense.

00:41:47.468 --> 00:41:52.889
Ok. The biggest the cube
can be then is...

00:41:53.599 --> 00:41:57.016
26 rooms high,
26 rooms across, so...

00:41:57.478 --> 00:41:59.887
17.576 rooms.

00:42:00.398 --> 00:42:04.099
Seventeen thousand, five hundred
and seventy-six rooms?

00:42:06.696 --> 00:42:08.155
That makes me queasy.

00:42:12.202 --> 00:42:13.317
Descartes!

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.291
- Leaven, you are a genius.
- What? What?

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:24.125
Cartesian coordinates. Of course,
coded cartesian coordinates.

00:42:24.424 --> 00:42:27.377
They're used in geometry to plot
points on a 3-dimensional graph.

00:42:27.802 --> 00:42:29.628
In English, slower.

00:42:30.305 --> 00:42:33.556
Bonjour?
These numbers are markers,

00:42:33.809 --> 00:42:36.726
and grid reference, like latitude
and longitude on a map.

00:42:37.063 --> 00:42:39.850
The numbers tell us where
we are inside the cube.

00:42:39.982 --> 00:42:41.357
Well, where are we?

00:42:45.196 --> 00:42:46.061
It works.

00:42:46.321 --> 00:42:50.153
Okay. All I have to do is add
the numbers together.

00:42:50.784 --> 00:42:52.576
The X coordinate is 19...

00:42:53.205 --> 00:42:57.202
Y is 26 rooms...

00:42:58.543 --> 00:43:00.038
So that places us...

00:43:03.049 --> 00:43:04.674
...seven rooms from the edge.

00:43:05.051 --> 00:43:07.210
All right, let's go.

00:43:07.595 --> 00:43:11.462
Just out of curiosity, I mean,
don't hit me again, or anything...

00:43:11.599 --> 00:43:12.797
but what are you gonna do
when you get there?

00:43:12.892 --> 00:43:14.434
Maybe we can get the door open.

00:43:15.853 --> 00:43:19.187
What we need is to do figure out
how to get around the traps.

00:43:19.274 --> 00:43:20.519
I'm dealing with that Holloway.

00:43:20.608 --> 00:43:22.187
I'm looking for
practical solutions here.

00:43:22.528 --> 00:43:24.520
Well, you haven't found any yet.

00:43:28.117 --> 00:43:32.660
We cut the risk with the numbers
and the boot. Worth will go in first.

00:43:32.746 --> 00:43:35.533
No, he won't Quentin!
We take turns!

00:43:36.833 --> 00:43:37.782
Relax.

00:43:46.386 --> 00:43:47.500
Room for two in there?

00:43:53.894 --> 00:43:55.009
What's the matter?

00:43:55.479 --> 00:43:58.848
These coordinates. 14, 27, 14.

00:43:59.482 --> 00:44:01.772
- What about 'em?
- They don't make sense.

00:44:02.237 --> 00:44:04.229
Assuming the cube is
26 rooms across,

00:44:04.363 --> 00:44:06.273
there can't be
a coordinate larger than 26.

00:44:06.867 --> 00:44:09.108
If this were right, then
we would be outside of the cube.

00:44:12.081 --> 00:44:14.204
No, not outside of the cube.

00:44:16.167 --> 00:44:17.911
I guess that means
we're not having dinner.

00:44:18.711 --> 00:44:25.047
Trap. Trap. Trap. Trap.

00:44:27.305 --> 00:44:28.467
Trap!

00:44:35.981 --> 00:44:37.144
Trap!

00:44:42.445 --> 00:44:43.643
Sound activated.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:01.039
Lovely.

00:45:02.342 --> 00:45:04.915
How come the sound of the door
opening didn't set it off?

00:45:05.511 --> 00:45:06.971
Must be rigged to ignore it.

00:45:07.055 --> 00:45:09.761
So that's it. The edge is
surrounded by traps.

00:45:09.892 --> 00:45:13.557
Well, I guess we have to backtrack,
and try somewhere else.

00:45:13.687 --> 00:45:15.846
Who knows how many detours
we'll have to take.

00:45:16.482 --> 00:45:18.226
I say we cross the bitch.

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:19.939
Right!

00:45:20.987 --> 00:45:23.109
How many boots do we have left,
Holloway?

00:45:27.369 --> 00:45:28.567
Get it off him.

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.737
We know how it works.
We just have to be quiet.

00:45:32.041 --> 00:45:33.618
That's pretty fucking quiet.

00:45:33.917 --> 00:45:37.453
I'm glad you're on side,
Worth, 'cause... you're up.

00:45:39.048 --> 00:45:40.246
And he is not coming.

00:45:40.717 --> 00:45:42.127
Of course, he is.

00:45:42.218 --> 00:45:45.337
- No way.
- We are not leaving him behind.

00:45:45.471 --> 00:45:46.586
He's unpredictable.

00:45:46.973 --> 00:45:48.515
When we get to the edge,
we can come back for him.

00:45:48.599 --> 00:45:50.343
But he'll get somebody killed here.

00:45:50.685 --> 00:45:51.716
Am I right?

00:45:53.897 --> 00:45:55.095
Shame on you.

00:45:55.942 --> 00:45:57.815
Will you look at yourselves?

00:45:59.069 --> 00:46:00.611
What have you turned into?

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:05.111
They may have taken our lives away,
but we are still human beings.

00:46:06.119 --> 00:46:07.827
That's all we've got left.

00:46:10.248 --> 00:46:11.659
We'll come back for him.

00:46:13.167 --> 00:46:15.208
That's a lie and you know it.

00:46:25.431 --> 00:46:26.427
He'll be quiet.

00:49:02.557 --> 00:49:05.131
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna wait for him.

00:49:05.727 --> 00:49:07.553
- No.
- You go out, I'm here.

00:49:07.895 --> 00:49:08.927
Okay.

00:49:20.576 --> 00:49:21.690
This way.

00:51:06.522 --> 00:51:09.227
- You fucking fuck!
- That's enough!

00:51:09.317 --> 00:51:11.986
- He is a trap!
- Let him go right now!

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:14.692
The law of the jungle!
He is endangering the pack!

00:51:14.865 --> 00:51:16.941
Let him go, you Nazi!

00:51:19.287 --> 00:51:20.449
What did you call me?

00:51:20.621 --> 00:51:23.373
Quentin, you let
that innocent boy go.

00:51:25.459 --> 00:51:27.332
You listen to me, woman.

00:51:28.087 --> 00:51:31.171
Everyday I mop up
after your bleeding heart.

00:51:31.799 --> 00:51:35.584
The only reason you
even exist is because I keep you.

00:51:36.721 --> 00:51:37.966
I know your type,

00:51:38.849 --> 00:51:42.183
no kids, no man to fuck you.

00:51:42.728 --> 00:51:44.436
So you go around outraged,

00:51:44.771 --> 00:51:47.097
sticking your nose up
other people's assholes,

00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:48.732
sniffing their business!!!

00:51:50.986 --> 00:51:52.896
You missed your boat, Holloway.

00:51:55.992 --> 00:51:58.447
You're all dried up
inside there, aren't you?

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.828
That's your fucking problem.

00:52:01.665 --> 00:52:03.954
How dare you say that to her?

00:52:05.085 --> 00:52:08.251
You don't know her, Quentin.
None of us know each other here.

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:11.831
- Oh, I do.
- No you don't.

00:52:12.218 --> 00:52:14.625
No wonder your wife left you.

00:52:16.471 --> 00:52:19.757
All that bottled up anger.

00:52:21.812 --> 00:52:24.054
And a thing for young girls.

00:52:34.407 --> 00:52:35.986
God help you, Quentin.

00:52:37.994 --> 00:52:40.154
Did you smack
your kids around too?

00:52:54.679 --> 00:52:59.342
Is anybody besides me interested in
what's on the other side of that door?

00:53:02.521 --> 00:53:03.517
Open it.

00:53:11.156 --> 00:53:14.405
Door number six? Not number one?
Door number two?

00:53:16.201 --> 00:53:17.695
Open the fuckin' thing.

00:53:20.206 --> 00:53:23.908
Oh, sunshine.

00:53:49.738 --> 00:53:50.770
Night time.

00:53:51.657 --> 00:53:53.484
My old friend, the shell.

00:53:56.036 --> 00:53:59.037
It's there. Morning!

00:54:02.585 --> 00:54:03.450
Hang on to me.

00:54:12.137 --> 00:54:13.335
I can't see shit.

00:54:15.807 --> 00:54:17.006
Nothin' to hang on to.

00:54:22.397 --> 00:54:23.476
We gotta try something.

00:54:24.107 --> 00:54:25.601
We gotta see
if the door's over there.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.147
Someone has to swing
over there, and take a look.

00:54:29.488 --> 00:54:30.354
Swing?

00:54:32.367 --> 00:54:34.858
We make a rope,
out of clothes.

00:54:36.038 --> 00:54:37.746
Take 'em off.
I'll tie it around myself.

00:54:38.457 --> 00:54:39.702
Ah, yeah, and you're gonna go.

00:54:39.959 --> 00:54:42.331
You weight like 500 ponds,
it'll snap in two seconds.

00:54:43.295 --> 00:54:44.326
I'm the lightest.

00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:45.996
Forget it.

00:54:46.632 --> 00:54:47.627
I'll go.

00:54:48.926 --> 00:54:50.207
I'm going, Holloway.

00:54:50.844 --> 00:54:53.003
She's right Quentin,
you're too heavy.

00:54:53.347 --> 00:54:55.008
I'm the lightest after Leaven.

00:54:55.892 --> 00:54:57.470
Anyway, it's my turn.

00:55:04.025 --> 00:55:06.980
How long did you know
people were being put in here?

00:55:07.904 --> 00:55:09.184
A couple of months.

00:55:09.948 --> 00:55:11.228
That's not long,

00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:13.194
if you consider your whole life.

00:55:14.162 --> 00:55:15.110
I am.

00:55:16.372 --> 00:55:18.530
You opened my eyes Worht.
That's something.

00:55:20.918 --> 00:55:21.749
David.

00:55:23.964 --> 00:55:24.795
Helen.

00:55:28.177 --> 00:55:29.587
You're such a Helen.

00:56:17.896 --> 00:56:19.555
That's as far as you go.

00:56:24.195 --> 00:56:25.736
There's nothing down here.

00:56:27.656 --> 00:56:28.652
Hold tight.

00:56:29.867 --> 00:56:31.410
I try swinging over there.

00:56:41.004 --> 00:56:42.796
Brace yourselves,
I'm gonna try again.

00:56:48.929 --> 00:56:54.137
- Okay, one more time.
- Hurry, you're getting heavy.

00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:07.357
What the hell's going on?

00:57:07.866 --> 00:57:09.490
Get up here now!

00:57:42.111 --> 00:57:43.688
- Quentin!
- Have you got her?

00:57:44.321 --> 00:57:48.236
- What's going on?
- Quentin, is she okay?

00:58:14.478 --> 00:58:18.691
She... slipped.

00:58:20.194 --> 00:58:21.225
Holloway?

00:58:53.019 --> 00:58:54.644
Hey, shhh...
Come on, Kazan.

00:58:56.649 --> 00:58:58.606
Kazan, will you please
stop doing that?

00:58:59.569 --> 00:59:03.317
Leaven, you got be strong,
sweetheart.

00:59:03.447 --> 00:59:04.776
Don't even talk to me.

00:59:07.285 --> 00:59:08.864
We gotta get down to the bottom.

00:59:11.122 --> 00:59:13.363
It will be easier to get on
to the shell from there.

00:59:15.419 --> 00:59:17.910
It's a long fucking way
with only one boot.

00:59:18.255 --> 00:59:20.580
But we gotta do it
before we get too weak.

00:59:22.176 --> 00:59:24.085
You gotta keep
cracking the numbers, Leaven.

00:59:25.429 --> 00:59:27.008
I can't think anymore.

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:30.141
Sure you can. It's your gift.

00:59:30.727 --> 00:59:33.811
It's not a gift. It's just a brain.

00:59:34.981 --> 00:59:38.018
Let her sleep for a while. We haven't
slept in fuck knows how long.

00:59:39.569 --> 00:59:40.732
All right.

00:59:42.364 --> 00:59:43.442
One hour.

00:59:44.241 --> 00:59:46.614
How the fuck are you gonna know
how long an hour is?

00:59:48.454 --> 00:59:50.992
An hour is as long as I say.

01:00:56.026 --> 01:00:57.307
What are you doing?

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:00.941
We have to make it down
to the bottom.

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:03.198
It'll be quiet there, and
you can concentrate.

01:01:04.868 --> 01:01:07.407
- You just want to leave them?
- They're traps, Leaven.

01:01:08.664 --> 01:01:09.743
We are the key.

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:12.622
I'll get us down there.
You think us out.

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:14.200
Believe in me!

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:17.417
Try and see what I see,
how my mind works.

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:20.385
The flash when I look into someone's
head like a fucking X-ray.

01:01:24.056 --> 01:01:25.301
I looked through the walls.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:30.229
I dreamed him at his desk,
designing everything.

01:01:32.857 --> 01:01:34.565
He can't let you solve the puzzle,
see, 'cause

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:35.895
there is a purpose.

01:01:36.444 --> 01:01:37.903
We are the purpose. The cube...

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.860
...is us.

01:01:41.575 --> 01:01:44.742
- Quentin.
- We fit. Like numbers.

01:01:46.371 --> 01:01:49.326
A man and a woman.
Two halves of the equation.

01:01:50.626 --> 01:01:54.244
I take you down, the perfect key.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.291
I slip you in the lock.

01:02:01.721 --> 01:02:05.007
Leaven, it's time to go down.

01:02:19.824 --> 01:02:20.855
Get away from her.

01:02:23.077 --> 01:02:25.782
Leaven, they're fuckin' spies.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.408
Him, the retard.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.621
Holloway, had outside
information about my family...

01:02:30.711 --> 01:02:33.629
but she slipped up, didn't she?
She crossed the line!

01:02:36.382 --> 01:02:38.008
You dropped her.

01:02:41.888 --> 01:02:43.051
Just go, Quentin.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.758
Give us the boot, you pig!

01:03:05.914 --> 01:03:07.493
You don't want the boot.

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:31.855
You want to came with us, Worth?
Down the hatch.

01:03:39.785 --> 01:03:41.113
What the fuck's with him?

01:04:29.336 --> 01:04:30.534
How did...

01:04:32.423 --> 01:04:37.335
It's, it's, it's the Wren.
It's the old Wrenster.

01:04:39.264 --> 01:04:40.509
How could...

01:04:41.433 --> 01:04:43.759
We've been going around in circles.

01:04:44.771 --> 01:04:45.802
That can't be.

01:04:50.276 --> 01:04:52.352
- Where are we?
- I don't know!

01:04:54.364 --> 01:04:56.652
Where are we?

01:05:02.123 --> 01:05:03.368
You figure it out!

01:05:03.583 --> 01:05:07.248
You haven't done anything.
All you do is freak out you,

01:05:07.836 --> 01:05:09.165
murderer!

01:05:51.425 --> 01:05:53.085
I guess you were right, Worth.

01:05:54.345 --> 01:05:56.088
There is no way out of here.

01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:24.202
Get away from me.

01:06:59.289 --> 01:07:00.949
Wasn't Rennes killed in that room?

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:13.671
How come there's nothing out there?

01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:17.554
It's the edge.

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:20.472
We weren't at the edge before.
Where's the room that killed Rennes?

01:07:21.563 --> 01:07:22.761
Fuck off!

01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:28.772
Oh, that was good.

01:07:29.488 --> 01:07:33.106
What difference does it make?
We're dead anyways.

01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:37.826
Hey, listen to what I'm saying.
There was a room there before.

01:07:40.165 --> 01:07:43.250
We haven't been moving in circles.
The rooms have.

01:07:43.627 --> 01:07:46.119
- Of course.
- The rooms?

01:07:46.465 --> 01:07:48.172
That explains
the thunder and the shaking.

01:07:48.299 --> 01:07:50.007
We've been shifting the whole time.

01:07:52.094 --> 01:07:54.550
It's the only logical explanation.

01:07:57.268 --> 01:07:58.975
I'm such an idiot!

01:07:59.812 --> 01:08:02.267
- What are you on to, Leaven?
- Give me a minute.

01:08:05.068 --> 01:08:07.605
The numbers are markers,
points on a map, right?

01:08:08.113 --> 01:08:08.978
Right.

01:08:10.198 --> 01:08:13.447
How do you map a point
that keeps moving?

01:08:16.663 --> 01:08:17.943
Permutations.

01:08:20.458 --> 01:08:21.454
Permu what?

01:08:22.586 --> 01:08:23.617
Permutations.

01:08:23.712 --> 01:08:26.382
A list of all the coordinates
that the room passes through.

01:08:26.465 --> 01:08:28.339
Like a map, that tells you
where the rooms starts,

01:08:28.426 --> 01:08:30.798
how many times it moves,
and where it moves to.

01:08:32.013 --> 01:08:33.672
The numbers tell you all that?

01:08:34.182 --> 01:08:35.806
I don't know,

01:08:35.892 --> 01:08:37.766
see, I've only been looking
at one point on the map,

01:08:37.852 --> 01:08:39.891
which is probably
the starting position.

01:08:40.563 --> 01:08:44.016
All I saw was what the cube looked
like before it started to move.

01:08:44.276 --> 01:08:45.604
Okay, so it's moving.

01:08:49.031 --> 01:08:50.276
How do we get out?

01:08:52.826 --> 01:08:54.108
27.

01:08:58.499 --> 01:09:00.242
I know where the exit is.

01:09:01.585 --> 01:09:02.498
Where?

01:09:03.338 --> 01:09:05.663
- Stay away from me.
- Back off, Quentin.

01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:08.122
I just wanna know.

01:09:09.386 --> 01:09:10.714
Don't you wanna know?

01:09:14.767 --> 01:09:16.973
You remember that room
we passed through before,

01:09:17.227 --> 01:09:19.515
the one with the coordinate
larger than 26?

01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:21.011
What about it?

01:09:22.108 --> 01:09:26.188
That coordinate placed the room
outside the cube.

01:09:28.864 --> 01:09:29.778
A bridge.

01:09:30.282 --> 01:09:33.699
Right.
But only in its original position.

01:09:35.331 --> 01:09:36.611
What are you talking about?

01:09:40.501 --> 01:09:43.706
Look.
The room starts off as a bridge,

01:09:43.798 --> 01:09:45.836
and then it moves its way
through the maze,

01:09:45.924 --> 01:09:47.383
which is where we ran into it.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:50.845
But at some point,
it must return to its original position.

01:09:50.931 --> 01:09:53.931
- So a bridge is only a bridge.
- For a short period of time.

01:09:54.393 --> 01:09:56.966
This thing is like
a giant combination lock.

01:09:57.062 --> 01:09:59.469
When the rooms are in their
starting position, the lock is open.

01:09:59.564 --> 01:10:02.056
But when they move
out of alignment, the lock closes.

01:10:02.234 --> 01:10:04.143
With a structure this size,
it must take days

01:10:04.236 --> 01:10:06.109
for the rooms
to complete a full cycle.

01:10:06.655 --> 01:10:08.030
So, when does it open?

01:10:17.583 --> 01:10:18.615
Don't.

01:10:19.251 --> 01:10:21.743
To find the original coordinates,
the numbers are added together.

01:10:21.838 --> 01:10:24.591
To find the permutations, they're
subtracted from one another.

01:10:27.843 --> 01:10:28.508
That's it!

01:10:29.638 --> 01:10:33.173
This room moves to zero,
1 and -1 on the X-axis.

01:10:33.308 --> 01:10:35.348
2, 5 and -7 on Y.

01:10:35.978 --> 01:10:38.813
And 1, and -1 and zero on Z.

01:10:39.024 --> 01:10:40.482
And what does that mean?

01:10:41.193 --> 01:10:42.473
You suck at math?

01:10:42.986 --> 01:10:45.559
Okay, I need the room numbers
around us as reference points.

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:51.941
666, 897, 466.

01:10:53.955 --> 01:10:58.701
- 567, 898. Okay?
- Yes.

01:10:58.794 --> 01:11:01.961
And 545.
Did you get that?

01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:10.257
656, 778, 462.

01:11:11.682 --> 01:11:15.930
That's enough.
X is 17, Y is 25 and Z is 14.

01:11:19.191 --> 01:11:21.480
Which means
this room makes 2 more moves

01:11:21.568 --> 01:11:23.608
before returning
to its original position.

01:11:23.695 --> 01:11:25.570
- Do we have time?
- Maybe.

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:26.527
Then let's go!

01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:28.236
Can you work
the traps into this system?

01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:30.319
Fuck the traps.
Let's get to the bridge.

01:11:30.412 --> 01:11:32.867
You threw out our last boot,
you fucking idiot.

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:35.825
- Technically, I can identify the traps.
- Technically?

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.454
At first, I thought
that they were identified

01:11:37.544 --> 01:11:39.287
by prime numbers,
but they are not.

01:11:39.379 --> 01:11:41.834
They are identified by numbers
that are the power of a prime.

01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:43.833
- Ok, so?
- Can you calculate that?

01:11:44.593 --> 01:11:45.623
The numbers are huge.

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:48.008
But you can, right? She can.

01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:50.761
I'd have to calculate
the number of factors in each set.

01:11:50.934 --> 01:11:52.178
Maybe if I had a computer.

01:11:52.268 --> 01:11:54.011
- You don't need a computer.
- Yes I do.

01:11:54.103 --> 01:11:55.680
- Figure it out.
- I can't.

01:11:55.771 --> 01:11:58.476
I'm not dying in a fucking rat maze!

01:11:59.109 --> 01:12:02.524
Look. Nobody in the whole world
could do it mentally.

01:12:02.612 --> 01:12:06.112
Look at the numbers. 567898545.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.073
There's no way I can factor that!

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:13.535
I can't even start on 567!
It's astronomical!

01:12:15.585 --> 01:12:16.498
2.

01:12:20.756 --> 01:12:22.713
Astronomical.

01:12:23.884 --> 01:12:25.083
What did you say?

01:12:25.637 --> 01:12:27.879
Astronomical.

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:29.469
Before that.

01:12:31.352 --> 01:12:32.430
Factors.

01:12:33.603 --> 01:12:36.641
How many factors Kazan?
Of 567.

01:12:37.317 --> 01:12:38.230
2.

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:40.602
What, are you fucking kidding?

01:12:41.403 --> 01:12:44.024
Kazan. How many
factors does 30 have?

01:12:44.155 --> 01:12:44.987
3.

01:12:45.658 --> 01:12:48.612
- How about 7?
- 1. Gum drop.

01:12:49.245 --> 01:12:50.656
I don't have any gum drops.

01:12:51.372 --> 01:12:52.403
Gum drop.

01:12:52.832 --> 01:12:57.542
Kazan. I'll give you a whole box
of gum drops for each answer.

01:12:57.922 --> 01:12:59.997
Gum drops come in bags.

01:13:00.132 --> 01:13:02.207
Okay. You want them in bags,
they are coming in bags.

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.708
I don't like the red ones.

01:13:07.473 --> 01:13:10.557
- 898.
- 2.

01:13:11.894 --> 01:13:14.979
- 545.
- 2.

01:13:15.148 --> 01:13:16.642
He's giving us the factors.

01:13:17.234 --> 01:13:19.476
Astronomical.

01:13:20.361 --> 01:13:23.648
You're telling me
telethon boy is a genius?

01:13:24.824 --> 01:13:27.113
By those numbers,
the room should be safe.

01:13:27.577 --> 01:13:29.369
Only one way to find out.

01:13:31.498 --> 01:13:32.328
Don't!

01:13:36.963 --> 01:13:37.793
Safe.

01:13:38.965 --> 01:13:42.549
Kazan, my man.

01:13:46.181 --> 01:13:47.805
What's the number, buddy boy?

01:13:48.516 --> 01:13:51.851
Hey, right here, look here!

01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:54.564
Make him do it!

01:13:57.735 --> 01:14:00.226
Kazan, we're gonna do
some numbers now, okay?

01:14:00.321 --> 01:14:01.946
We like to do numbers, right?

01:14:02.449 --> 01:14:04.358
- Prime numbers.
- That's right.

01:14:04.701 --> 01:14:07.737
- Can you tell me the factor of 656?
- 2.

01:14:08.288 --> 01:14:10.779
- 779?
- 2.

01:14:10.999 --> 01:14:12.991
- 462?
- 3.

01:14:13.293 --> 01:14:14.574
- Clear.
- Move!

01:14:15.461 --> 01:14:18.546
Come on. Come on,
let's go. You too, Worth!

01:14:22.303 --> 01:14:25.921
Move your scawny ass, Worth.
I'm not through with you yet.

01:14:26.349 --> 01:14:27.594
Leaven, open that door.

01:14:27.767 --> 01:14:29.594
Get Einstein
working on the numbers.

01:14:33.064 --> 01:14:33.894
Oh, jeez.

01:14:33.982 --> 01:14:35.440
- Go!
- Worth!

01:14:35.608 --> 01:14:37.850
- Hurry!
- Leaven!

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:42.689
563!

01:14:43.909 --> 01:14:46.827
- Please, Kazan, 563?
- You fuckers, you're dead!

01:14:47.371 --> 01:14:49.031
- 2.
- Clear!

01:14:55.003 --> 01:14:57.411
- 1.
- Trapped!

01:15:00.927 --> 01:15:02.671
- Check the floor.
- Is he dead?

01:15:03.931 --> 01:15:04.926
Not quite.

01:15:05.515 --> 01:15:07.923
Not even close. Worth,
I'm getting out of here and

01:15:08.018 --> 01:15:10.344
I'll feed you to
a fucking trap on the way.

01:15:19.531 --> 01:15:20.610
Where is he?

01:15:21.157 --> 01:15:25.902
Come here. I said
come here right nooowwww!!

01:15:30.584 --> 01:15:32.873
Gotchya. That way.

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:36.839
- 2.
- Clear!

01:15:37.842 --> 01:15:38.873
- 4.
- Clear!

01:16:11.712 --> 01:16:14.249
Guess that proves our theory.
Numbers.

01:16:14.381 --> 01:16:17.715
- 4, 2, 3.
- Clear.

01:16:27.186 --> 01:16:29.511
Kazan!

01:16:49.626 --> 01:16:50.622
Listen.

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.372
- He hasn't moved far.
- I'll go find him.

01:17:01.222 --> 01:17:02.254
What do you think?

01:17:03.683 --> 01:17:05.308
You don't have a lot of lives left.

01:17:23.329 --> 01:17:26.781
- Kazan!
- I didn't move.

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:28.868
Yeah, good. But you're gonna have
to climb up here, okay?

01:17:28.961 --> 01:17:30.502
I don't like that.

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:49.981
14, 26, 14.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.607
Worth, get back here right now!

01:17:52.695 --> 01:17:54.188
Five bags of gum drops.

01:17:54.279 --> 01:17:57.030
27 bags total.

01:17:57.115 --> 01:17:58.360
27 bags. Deal.

01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:02.655
This room's next move
takes it to the bridge!

01:18:02.871 --> 01:18:03.951
We're coming!

01:18:06.959 --> 01:18:07.789
Over here!

01:18:08.711 --> 01:18:12.412
Move it! We don't have
much time. Come on.

01:18:44.666 --> 01:18:46.458
Worth? Worth?

01:18:49.504 --> 01:18:50.963
This better be it.

01:18:52.132 --> 01:18:53.164
It should be.

01:19:01.475 --> 01:19:02.258
Where?

01:19:14.114 --> 01:19:15.063
Oh, well!

01:19:18.493 --> 01:19:20.404
Give me a minute. Be patient.

01:19:21.706 --> 01:19:23.947
- So, guess what?
- No.

01:19:25.459 --> 01:19:27.499
This is the room we started in.

01:19:28.546 --> 01:19:32.591
I was right. We should
never have moved in the first place.

01:19:56.450 --> 01:19:57.695
The bridge.

01:19:59.037 --> 01:19:59.820
Red.

01:20:00.539 --> 01:20:01.570
Kazan?

01:20:05.378 --> 01:20:09.043
- 4, 2, 4.
- Clear!

01:21:11.615 --> 01:21:12.445
Worth!

01:21:16.244 --> 01:21:17.194
Go ahead.

01:21:17.829 --> 01:21:18.908
What are you doing?

01:21:19.122 --> 01:21:20.664
You can't quit now.

01:21:25.004 --> 01:21:26.997
It's not your fault!

01:21:27.506 --> 01:21:31.884
I have nothing to live for out there.

01:21:35.099 --> 01:21:36.379
What is out there?

01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:51.901
Boundless human stupidity.

01:21:58.623 --> 01:21:59.950
I can live with that.

01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:20.347
Noooooo!!!

01:22:25.192 --> 01:22:26.984
Kazan! Get out through the door!

01:22:55.934 --> 01:22:57.214
Red, Kazan.

01:25:32.215 --> 01:25:37.215
