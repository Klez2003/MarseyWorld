Get me in ten minutes, Ray.

00:00:52.087 --> 00:00:53.088
[Ray] Boss.

- Bobby.
- Boss?

00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:13.474
I'll have a pint
and a pickled egg.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.144
Coming straight up.

[man] If you wish to be
the king of the jungle,

00:01:49.178 --> 00:01:51.412
it's not enough
to act like a king.

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:55.918
You must be the king.

00:01:57.186 --> 00:01:58.854
And there can be no doubt.

00:01:59.988 --> 00:02:04.059
Because doubt causes chaos
and one's own demise.

00:02:15.403 --> 00:02:16.471
Hello, my love.

00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:18.606
It's date night tonight.

00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:20.943

00:05:07.175 --> 00:05:08.176
Fletcher.

00:05:08.777 --> 00:05:11.780
Buenas tardes, Raymondo.
[chuckles]

00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:15.616
I should stab you with
that fucking rolling pin.

00:05:15.751 --> 00:05:19.755
Oh, don't be cunty. I was just hoping we
could have a cozy little drink together.

00:05:20.222 --> 00:05:24.760
So, I've got a meeting on Saturday
at your favorite newspaper.

00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:30.299
As the best private investigator
in this smoky little town...

00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:32.566
good evening,
ladies and gentlemen...

00:05:32.701 --> 00:05:36.872
they are ready to put 150 grand in
my pocket to give them some filth.

00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:39.308
Good for me, that,
but in this case...

00:05:41.043 --> 00:05:42.244
it's bad for you.

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.382
So Big Dave,
editor extraordinaire,

00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:51.320
has developed a terrible
antipathy for your boss

00:05:51.452 --> 00:05:54.156
and his liquorish assortment
of tasty mates.

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:59.361
He's out to destroy him and all those
that cozy up to him. Front cover. Bosh!

00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:01.997
There will be blood and fucking
feathers everywhere, my darling.

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:05.100
Get to it, Fletcher.
I'm starting to itch.

00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:08.170
Now, we both know that your boss has
very, very deep pockets,

00:06:08.303 --> 00:06:11.340
and I would like to invite him just
to have a teeny rummage in them.

00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:14.676
What the fuck
are you talking about?

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.477
If you would be so kind

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.113
as to furnish me with
20 million British pounds,

00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:19.881
I will give you everything...

00:06:20.015 --> 00:06:23.118
memory cards, contact sheets,
recordings, the lot,

00:06:23.251 --> 00:06:26.688
and a modest little screenplay
I wrote all by myself.

00:06:26.822 --> 00:06:27.856
Hold on.

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:32.027
We just went from £150,000
to 20 million.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.329
That's a steep rise
in 30 seconds.

00:06:34.463 --> 00:06:37.299
Yeah, but I would argue that you're
lucky, because that is nothing

00:06:37.432 --> 00:06:41.136
compared to what I could,
and perhaps should, be asking.

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:44.206
Oh, well, thank God
you're not greedy, Fletcher,

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:46.708
you deluded,
shit-eating cunt.

00:06:46.842 --> 00:06:48.542
[chuckles]

00:06:48.677 --> 00:06:50.679
I quite like it
when you talk dirty to me.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.082
I can feel myself engorging.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.252
Come on, have a drink with me.
It's really yummy.

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:01.023
I looked it up. App-ed it.
1500 quid?

00:07:01.156 --> 00:07:03.759
I didn't know you could spend
that much on a bottle of scotch.

00:07:04.626 --> 00:07:09.331
I'm gonna tell you a story to
demonstrate why my quote is my quote.

00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:12.300
Will you play a game
with me, Ray?

00:07:13.502 --> 00:07:15.003
I don't wanna play a game.

00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:18.507
- Please?
- No.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.009
I said play a fucking game
with me, Ray.

00:07:22.177 --> 00:07:23.712
[teapot whistling]

00:07:29.718 --> 00:07:30.786
Right.

00:07:31.253 --> 00:07:32.354
Lovely.

00:07:32.854 --> 00:07:36.358
Now, I want you
to imagine a character,

00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:39.761
a dramatic character,
like in a book or a play or a film.

00:07:39.895 --> 00:07:42.497
But not digital,
not on a memory stick.

00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:46.068
Analog. Chemical process.
"Keep the grain in the picture," I say.

00:07:46.201 --> 00:07:47.702
Old-school, 35 mill.

00:07:47.836 --> 00:07:50.372
[whirring]

00:07:52.674 --> 00:07:54.409
Now, I'm seeing this
through a lens, I am,

00:07:54.543 --> 00:07:56.311
and I'm not talking about
the small screen.

00:07:56.445 --> 00:07:58.046
It's not TV, Raymond.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.049
As I said,
old-school cinema format.

00:08:01.183 --> 00:08:04.986
It's what we in the business called
anamorphic, or ratio 2.35 to 1.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.889
And I want you to join me
on this cinematic journey,

00:08:08.023 --> 00:08:09.791
'cause it is cinema, Ray.

00:08:09.925 --> 00:08:12.894
It's beautiful,
beautiful cinema.

00:08:13.829 --> 00:08:16.364
Now, roll camera.

00:08:16.498 --> 00:08:18.266
[whirring]

00:08:18.567 --> 00:08:20.902
Enter our protagonist.

00:08:21.036 --> 00:08:23.205
He's good-looking,
he's gorgeous,

00:08:23.338 --> 00:08:26.607
he's golden age,
he's a proper handsome cunt.

00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:30.245
His name is Mickey Pearson.

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:32.914
Unique background
has our Mickey.

00:08:33.048 --> 00:08:37.786
American born, Rhodes scholar,
so he's born clever but poor.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.589
Now, that's quite a leap from
a trailer park in Americana

00:08:40.722 --> 00:08:43.624
to the thousand-year-old
university in old Angleterre,

00:08:43.758 --> 00:08:47.129
where he studies
the dark art of horticulture.

00:08:47.262 --> 00:08:50.332
But he never finished his education,
never went home, because...

00:08:50.465 --> 00:08:52.634
he found his vocation.

00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:54.069
A naughty vocation.

00:08:54.903 --> 00:08:56.438
He's a bad boy.

00:08:56.571 --> 00:08:59.174
He starts dealing
the dirty wonder weed

00:08:59.307 --> 00:09:02.477
to his rich, British,
upper-class uni pals

00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:04.946
and realizes
he's rather good at it.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.849
He's clear and objective
about ambition

00:09:07.983 --> 00:09:11.486
and he can surf the echelons
of our complicated culture.

00:09:12.921 --> 00:09:16.358
He knew how to take advantage
of his advantage.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.028
He was a hungry animal,
you see.

00:09:20.162 --> 00:09:23.165
He was powerful and ruthless,
cunning and quick,

00:09:23.298 --> 00:09:25.667
charismatic and smart, but...

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.537
he had to do some naughty
things to get where he got,

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.305
to establish his position,

00:09:30.438 --> 00:09:33.074
to show he wasn't just
teeth, tits and tan.

00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:36.011
Well, he wasn't
fucking hollow, was he?

00:09:37.479 --> 00:09:38.780
[Fletcher moans]

00:09:38.914 --> 00:09:40.448
He had an engine
under his hood

00:09:40.582 --> 00:09:42.984
and a gun in his holster.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.889
So, he's not exactly clean,
our Mickey.

00:09:48.023 --> 00:09:49.791
He has come up the hard way.

00:09:49.925 --> 00:09:52.527
He's earned his position,
shall we say.

00:09:52.662 --> 00:09:54.362
Well, that was the early days,

00:09:54.496 --> 00:09:57.532
and he cracked on with
his New World pioneer spirit.

00:09:58.233 --> 00:10:01.836
What's he worth today?
100, 200, 500 million?

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.573
But now the plot
begins to thicken.

00:10:04.706 --> 00:10:07.275
He has reached
a crossroads in his life.

00:10:07.409 --> 00:10:09.711
The middle class and the middle
age, they've got to him.

00:10:09.844 --> 00:10:13.381
They've corrupted his appetite
for the horrors. He's gone soft.

00:10:13.515 --> 00:10:16.384
He wanted to cash in his chips
and get out of the game,

00:10:16.518 --> 00:10:19.087
and he seems to have found
the perfect customer.

00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:20.555
Smash cut, please...

00:10:21.056 --> 00:10:23.058
to interior, a gala dinner.

00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:26.127
Just a few words to say
thank you to Michael Pearson

00:10:26.261 --> 00:10:28.730
for his limitless generosity
and time.

00:10:28.863 --> 00:10:33.335
Now, Mickey has been cultivating
a special relationship

00:10:33.468 --> 00:10:37.739
with the erudite, learned and
broad-minded Matthew Berger.

00:10:37.872 --> 00:10:41.243
Yes, Raymond, I do know about
the Jewish billionaire cowboy,

00:10:41.376 --> 00:10:44.446
another slice of Americana
creating drama in Angleterre.

00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:48.583
And finally to Matthew Berger
blindsiding us with his donation

00:10:48.718 --> 00:10:51.886
to build the entire cognitive
behavioral therapy unit.

00:10:52.387 --> 00:10:54.724
[Fletcher] So these two have met before.
Fuck knows where.

00:10:54.856 --> 00:10:58.793
Presumably at the annual international
drug dealers convention in Las Vegas.

00:10:58.927 --> 00:11:00.996
And they've done
some small deals together,

00:11:01.129 --> 00:11:03.465
but now they're ready
for the big one.

00:11:03.598 --> 00:11:06.368
Well, that was unexpected,
Matthew.

00:11:07.068 --> 00:11:09.304
Now I understand why you're
seated at the head of the table.

00:11:09.437 --> 00:11:12.073
Snuck that one right by me, didn't
you, you naughty little girl?

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.476
Making a splash
with the gentry.

00:11:14.609 --> 00:11:17.178
Oh, I like to make a splash
whenever possible.

00:11:17.647 --> 00:11:21.449
Well, you also seem to understand
the significance of a proper attire.

00:11:21.583 --> 00:11:22.984
Indeed I do.

00:11:23.118 --> 00:11:24.419
I believe
a sense of ownership

00:11:24.552 --> 00:11:26.254
is vital
in every aspect of life,

00:11:26.388 --> 00:11:28.758
perhaps never more so than
when it comes to wardrobe.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.594
For every look there is a season,
and for every season a strategy.

00:11:32.728 --> 00:11:35.130
[Fletcher]
Now starts the alpha dance.

00:11:35.263 --> 00:11:36.898
They're not really talking
about clothes, Raymond.

00:11:37.032 --> 00:11:38.634
Oh, fucking no.

00:11:38.768 --> 00:11:40.435
They're like
a pair of old doggies

00:11:40.568 --> 00:11:43.004
sniffing round one another's
intellectual assholes.

00:11:43.138 --> 00:11:45.807
It's a good old-fashioned
cock-off, Raymond.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.644
Michael, I'm looking forward
to doing business together.

00:11:49.144 --> 00:11:51.613
- May we excuse ourselves?
- Yes, please.

00:11:52.547 --> 00:11:54.349
We should say good night
to our host.

00:11:59.254 --> 00:12:00.588
So what do you think?

00:12:01.156 --> 00:12:02.692
I'm not sure.

00:12:02.824 --> 00:12:03.825
[Matthew] Your Grace.

00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.360
[woman] He's a fox,

00:12:05.493 --> 00:12:07.162
and foxes
have a predictable nature.

00:12:07.295 --> 00:12:09.064
Trust this Jew
about that Jew.

00:12:09.197 --> 00:12:10.666
If you let him
in the henhouse,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.668
you can expect blood
and feathers everywhere.

00:12:13.803 --> 00:12:16.304
Fresh from
a farmyard pheasant shoot,

00:12:16.438 --> 00:12:19.174
these two are starting
to like each other.

00:12:19.307 --> 00:12:21.843
It's looking good, Ray.
It's looking fucking good.

00:12:21.976 --> 00:12:24.579
- [gunshot]
- I'm impressed with what you've done with your enterprise.

00:12:24.714 --> 00:12:26.848
You see, try as I might,
I can't work out how you do it,

00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:28.751
and bush is my game.

00:12:28.883 --> 00:12:31.386
How does anyone grow
50 tons of super skunk

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:33.421
without letting anyone else
know how they do it?

00:12:33.555 --> 00:12:35.957
I'm flattered to hear that
from you, Matthew.

00:12:36.091 --> 00:12:38.493
I imagine that big brain of yours
is sweating a stream of tears

00:12:38.627 --> 00:12:40.195
just trying
to figure it out.

00:12:40.328 --> 00:12:41.797
Brilliance
should be acknowledged.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:42.997
Mm.

00:12:43.131 --> 00:12:44.866
Run the numbers
by me again.

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:48.570
200 million gross p.a.,
100 million net.

00:12:48.704 --> 00:12:50.138
But your people
know this already.

00:12:50.271 --> 00:12:52.340
They've swept the numbers
for months now.

00:12:52.474 --> 00:12:56.378
The bottom line is I'll sell
it to you for 400 million.

00:13:02.984 --> 00:13:05.286
But you knew that already.
Hop in.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.056
[Fletcher] Now, I can't be specific
about the heroes and zeros,

00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:10.626
but there was a lot of money
hanging in the balance.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.262
Question: What would it be
worth to have the power

00:13:14.396 --> 00:13:16.965
to be able to pull the plug
on an operation like that?

00:13:17.098 --> 00:13:21.202
Answer: A greedy man would
want half the sale price,

00:13:21.336 --> 00:13:24.372
but a smart man would know
that 20 million pounds

00:13:24.506 --> 00:13:27.909
was just about uncomfortable enough
to make everyone feel comfortable.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.647
You're a cunning and creative
toad, aren't you, Fletcher,

00:13:31.781 --> 00:13:33.615
coming up
with a plan like this?

00:13:33.749 --> 00:13:35.651
Yeah, but I didn't really
come up with it, did I?

00:13:35.785 --> 00:13:37.252
It was Big Dave.

00:13:37.385 --> 00:13:39.020
He commissioned me
to do a job on Mickey,

00:13:39.154 --> 00:13:40.689
you know, sniff about,
keep an eye on him,

00:13:40.823 --> 00:13:42.758
go through his bins,
reveal his sins.

00:13:43.391 --> 00:13:47.595
Mickey Pearson, the odious Yankee gangster.
We're gonna bury him.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.533
Because it seems he's got himself
a new friend. Lord Pressfield.

00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:54.602
Question:
Is that the Lord Pressfield?

00:13:54.936 --> 00:13:56.304
His Grace, the duke?

00:13:56.438 --> 00:13:59.073
Yeah. Once fourth in line
to the throne.

00:13:59.207 --> 00:14:00.776
Apparently Mickey Pearson
has squeaked his way

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:03.211
into the crack
of his fat, posh ass.

00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:07.817
This is yours, Fletcher. I need a man
with your creativity, with your nose.

00:14:07.949 --> 00:14:09.652
Now, you know
you're my favorite bloodhound.

00:14:09.785 --> 00:14:11.586
I just think it's really
important to remember

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.154
who you're talking to, Dave.

00:14:13.288 --> 00:14:15.490
Of course I remember,
Fletcher.

00:14:15.623 --> 00:14:18.526
So just make absolutely sure the
check doesn't disappoint this time.

00:14:19.427 --> 00:14:21.329
The number is 150,000.

00:14:21.664 --> 00:14:24.365
He wants to ruin him,

00:14:24.499 --> 00:14:27.435
but I am here
to do you a favor.

00:14:28.671 --> 00:14:31.339
And it's not like you're not
getting something for your money.

00:14:31.473 --> 00:14:34.609
You could even turn that script
into a feature film, Raymond.

00:14:35.176 --> 00:14:38.379
We could make it together.
We could be partners.

00:14:39.113 --> 00:14:40.850
I have learned off you lot.

00:14:41.149 --> 00:14:44.586
You gotta look after number
one, and now it's my turn.

00:14:45.754 --> 00:14:49.491
The sun is not going up
for me, Ray. It's going down.

00:14:50.893 --> 00:14:53.929
So why has Big Dave
got it in for my boss?

00:14:54.062 --> 00:14:56.097
Two months ago,
your man Mickey

00:14:56.231 --> 00:14:58.834
made my man Dave feel
like a right fucking idiot.

00:14:58.968 --> 00:15:00.836
Henry. Mickey.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.103
How did he do that?

00:15:02.237 --> 00:15:03.605
Didn't accept his hand.

00:15:03.739 --> 00:15:05.708
- Dave. Daily Print.
- Yes.

00:15:06.574 --> 00:15:08.644
No. Editor
of the Daily Print.

00:15:08.777 --> 00:15:11.546
[Fletcher] Turns out Dave had
gone after one of Mickey's lords,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.581
did a proper tabloid job
on him.

00:15:13.716 --> 00:15:15.885
It would appear that His
Lordship had had a quick spin

00:15:16.017 --> 00:15:18.253
on one of
his attractive young footmen.

00:15:18.386 --> 00:15:20.990
After the splash, shares
crashed, job went, wife followed,

00:15:21.122 --> 00:15:23.191
and even his kids
disowned him.

00:15:23.324 --> 00:15:25.628
Well, that Dave
can't half be a cunt.

00:15:26.394 --> 00:15:28.162
But no one
will pull him on it.

00:15:28.296 --> 00:15:30.598
Too fucking scared that Dave
will do a feature on them.

00:15:30.733 --> 00:15:33.535
But your Mickey, he's got
a fabulous set of balls.

00:15:33.669 --> 00:15:36.839
So he snubbed him in front of a crowd
that Dave could only wish he belonged to.

00:15:36.972 --> 00:15:40.208
You know, lords and ladies, the sort that
Mickey feels very comfortable in front of.

00:15:40.809 --> 00:15:42.978
Men, excuse us.

00:15:43.144 --> 00:15:45.146
[Fletcher] Well, he might just as
well have pulled Dave's cock off.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.016
I do believe that was a bit
of a fuck off, Dave. [laughs]

00:15:47.148 --> 00:15:49.117
[Fletcher] 'Cause he just
fizzled like a party balloon.

00:15:49.985 --> 00:15:51.854
That's no reason
to go after a fella.

00:15:51.987 --> 00:15:54.657
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
He wants Mickey's blood.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:58.259
And he would be getting it
too, if it wasn't for...

00:15:59.294 --> 00:16:02.731
You're a filthy fantasist,
and now it's time to leave.

00:16:02.865 --> 00:16:06.167
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm only just lubing you up.

00:16:06.301 --> 00:16:11.172
Now, there is a reason why Matthew,
or anyone else for that matter,

00:16:11.306 --> 00:16:14.275
cannot work out
how Mickey does what he does.

00:16:14.409 --> 00:16:18.212
How does he grow 50 tons of white
widow super cheese every year?

00:16:18.346 --> 00:16:20.248
Everyone knows
that needs a lot of space.

00:16:20.381 --> 00:16:23.786
So where is the space and how
come he's kept it under wraps?

00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:27.088
You can't just dig a hole in the ground
and drop 200 shipping containers in there.

00:16:27.221 --> 00:16:28.791
Oh, no, my love.
That will not work.

00:16:28.924 --> 00:16:32.728
No. You have to be creative.
You need an angle.

00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:35.664
The problem with land in this
country is there's not much of it...

00:16:37.032 --> 00:16:39.969
and there's public access even
when it's supposed to be private.

00:16:40.535 --> 00:16:43.438
And the public have rights:
dog walkers...

00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:45.239
- [horn honks]
- Yes, jog on.

00:16:45.373 --> 00:16:47.810
...footpaths, right to roam,

00:16:47.943 --> 00:16:49.410
bimblers, ramblers,

00:16:49.544 --> 00:16:50.980
- badger lovers...
- [squeaks]

00:16:51.714 --> 00:16:53.649
...and any other busy cunt
with enough time on his hands

00:16:53.782 --> 00:16:55.116
to sniff
the green tweed of England.

00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:56.752
- [man] Good morning!
- [dog barking]

00:16:56.885 --> 00:16:58.386
And they have groups,

00:16:58.519 --> 00:17:02.057
forums, meetings,
social media,

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.059
and they love
a good chat and a hiss

00:17:04.192 --> 00:17:06.895
about anyone who's decided to
mow his lawn without a license.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.299
And then there's the helicopters,
drones, Google Earth,

00:17:11.432 --> 00:17:13.501
heritage sites,
parish councils,

00:17:13.636 --> 00:17:15.004
and the beat goes on.

00:17:15.804 --> 00:17:18.272
And that's before you even think
about getting power in here.

00:17:20.643 --> 00:17:23.679
[Fletcher] So what is
Mickey's unique method?

00:17:23.812 --> 00:17:28.316
I tip my cap at the cheek,
at the elegance, at the class.

00:17:29.084 --> 00:17:31.053
And what would
that method be exactly?

00:17:31.185 --> 00:17:33.521
You have to understand
a culture to understand a man.

00:17:34.188 --> 00:17:36.025
Toffs, aristocrats,

00:17:36.157 --> 00:17:39.128
dukes, duchesses,
lords and ladies,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.130
lots of land
and fuck all dough.

00:17:41.262 --> 00:17:45.034
Houses to keep, damp to
keep out, silver to polish.

00:17:45.166 --> 00:17:48.169
You must remember
that cash is very persuasive

00:17:48.302 --> 00:17:51.707
to the class that got spanked by
angry lefties and death duties.

00:17:52.975 --> 00:17:56.544
And every time you inherit a
fortune, you lose half to the state.

00:17:56.679 --> 00:17:58.681
- [slurps]
- So this is my moment to swoop in

00:17:58.814 --> 00:18:00.849
like a guardian fucking angel

00:18:00.983 --> 00:18:04.385
and offer my services so they
can keep their houses in order.

00:18:04.519 --> 00:18:06.655
And they're not too bothered
about what I do,

00:18:07.122 --> 00:18:10.224
as long as that cash
keeps rolling in each year.

00:18:10.358 --> 00:18:13.128
It's good to get a lord, yes,
but it's not easy.

00:18:13.261 --> 00:18:17.066
It takes work,
wine, women and disco.

00:18:17.633 --> 00:18:20.401
Twelve sites. Twelve farms.

00:18:20.535 --> 00:18:23.438
One thousand of these estates
in the great UK.

00:18:23.571 --> 00:18:25.573
Bonne chance
trying to find them all.

00:18:26.742 --> 00:18:29.778
That's it. My infrastructure.

00:18:30.746 --> 00:18:35.349
And that, sir, is, with my
blessing, what you are paying for.

00:18:36.217 --> 00:18:38.787
If it's as discreet and as
lucrative as you claim it is,

00:18:38.921 --> 00:18:40.621
I'll buy the whole business.

00:18:40.923 --> 00:18:42.590
But enough foreplay, Michael.

00:18:43.192 --> 00:18:44.592
I wanna see your plant.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.762
[engine stops]

00:18:46.895 --> 00:18:48.997
I've gone to great lengths
to make my operation

00:18:49.131 --> 00:18:51.667
as invisible as possible,
Matthew.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.235
If you were standing on my
bush, you wouldn't know it.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.842
As a matter of fact,
you are standing on my bush.

00:19:02.811 --> 00:19:04.847
It's a spectacular business,
Michael.

00:19:05.881 --> 00:19:07.716
Such a shame it will go
bankrupt in ten years

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.952
when things go legal
in the great UK.

00:19:10.585 --> 00:19:12.921
And you want me
to pay top dollar for it?

00:19:13.222 --> 00:19:15.256
A nugget under half a yard?

00:19:16.524 --> 00:19:17.726
That is the price.

00:19:18.727 --> 00:19:21.496
Now step inside and I'll show
you what half a yard gets you.

00:19:26.467 --> 00:19:31.006
Ooh. A delightful tool shed
for 400 million dollars.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.441
Is the ball-peen hammer
included?

00:19:33.574 --> 00:19:36.477
Course it is.
Now let me show you the nails.

00:19:44.485 --> 00:19:45.586
Watch your head.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.656
Carry on, chaps.

00:19:58.901 --> 00:20:01.170
England's
green and pleasant land.

00:20:03.272 --> 00:20:04.773
Those are some nails.

00:20:06.141 --> 00:20:09.178
Location, staff, technology.

00:20:10.045 --> 00:20:13.949
See, you're buying the substructure
for the superstructure to come,

00:20:14.582 --> 00:20:18.253
and with purchase you will
inherit the best sites available,

00:20:18.386 --> 00:20:21.489
the finest botanists and herb
sommeliers in the world,

00:20:21.622 --> 00:20:25.194
as well as the most innovative
marijuana technology on the planet.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.897
And when this little piggy
goes to legal market

00:20:29.031 --> 00:20:32.067
and the demand
way outpaces the supply...

00:20:33.035 --> 00:20:36.470
these locations,
these green-fingered botanical boys,

00:20:36.604 --> 00:20:38.907
as well as
my superior technology,

00:20:39.041 --> 00:20:40.341
will be at a premium.

00:20:41.777 --> 00:20:43.178
And you would own them all.

00:20:46.014 --> 00:20:50.052
Did you know it took 15 years after
alcohol prohibition ended back home

00:20:50.185 --> 00:20:52.321
for the legal market
to scratch that itch?

00:20:53.121 --> 00:20:54.890
Fifteen years.

00:20:55.489 --> 00:20:57.592
And that's if
you do nothing with it.

00:20:58.293 --> 00:21:01.029
Yes, it's a win-win,
no matter how you look at it.

00:21:02.597 --> 00:21:04.867
And I'm not greedy.
You and I both know

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.203
that 400 million is a
fair-to-generous asking price,

00:21:09.104 --> 00:21:11.472
especially considering
that once this game's kosher,

00:21:11.606 --> 00:21:14.408
it's going to be worth
somewhere between 200 billion

00:21:14.542 --> 00:21:17.846
and, well,
half a trillion pounds.

00:21:18.213 --> 00:21:19.380
Annually.

00:21:20.048 --> 00:21:21.415
Weed.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.224
[chuckles]

00:21:29.358 --> 00:21:30.726
It's the new gold rush.

00:21:31.894 --> 00:21:34.863
This is the thin end
of a very fat wedge, sir.

00:21:35.596 --> 00:21:38.532
If it's such a fat wedge,
why don't you keep it?

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.872
You see, I've developed a reputation
as a man who came up the hard way.

00:21:44.605 --> 00:21:47.843
You could say that there's blood
on these pretty white hands.

00:21:48.844 --> 00:21:52.781
But in the new business,
once legal and under the jurisdiction

00:21:52.915 --> 00:21:56.919
of the respectable umbrella
of ministerial legitimacy,

00:21:57.052 --> 00:22:00.722
an enterprise like this will
need a face with a clean past,

00:22:00.856 --> 00:22:04.059
which sadly I do not possess.

00:22:04.192 --> 00:22:06.295
Retirement
doesn't sound so bad.

00:22:06.427 --> 00:22:09.865
Long walks in the countryside,
pruning roses with my better half,

00:22:09.998 --> 00:22:11.432
raising some cubs.

00:22:11.565 --> 00:22:14.136
[inhales] I've earned it.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:18.807
Look, we both know growing
is only 50% of the business.

00:22:19.607 --> 00:22:21.575
I need
your European connections.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:23.912
I've seen
how the sausage is made.

00:22:24.046 --> 00:22:25.546
Now tell me
about the butcher shops.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.183
Well, that comes later,
Matthew,

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.584
when the money's in escrow.

00:22:30.719 --> 00:22:34.022
Now that we've established
the dilemma of our protagonist,

00:22:34.156 --> 00:22:37.693
let us turn to our antagonist.

00:22:37.826 --> 00:22:40.696
Many miles away,
across the open plains,

00:22:40.829 --> 00:22:46.201
another beautiful feral beast
lopes his way to a watering hole.

00:22:46.335 --> 00:22:47.601
Who are you talking about
now?

00:22:47.736 --> 00:22:51.539
I talk, Raymondo, of Dry Eye.

00:22:51.673 --> 00:22:53.175
Oh, Dry Eye.

00:22:53.308 --> 00:22:56.044
What is he?
Chinese? Japanese? Pekingese?

00:22:56.178 --> 00:22:57.545
Get on your fucking knees?

00:22:57.679 --> 00:22:59.480

[Raymond] I'm gonna have to
stop you right there, Fletcher.

00:23:11.994 --> 00:23:13.862
That doesn't sound like
the Dry Eye I know.

00:23:13.996 --> 00:23:16.465
Just making sure you're
paying attention, Raymond.

00:23:16.597 --> 00:23:20.268
So let's cut instead
to a somewhat anticlimactic

00:23:20.402 --> 00:23:23.171

Dry Eye,

00:23:23.305 --> 00:23:25.140

Hose them down, load them up
and fuck them off.

00:23:44.059 --> 00:23:46.828
- Let me have a look at 432.

00:23:47.129 --> 00:23:48.196

00:23:51.967 --> 00:23:56.171
There's 120 rims, uh,
32 LS engines, 60 custom...

00:23:56.304 --> 00:23:58.106
All right. Pay the man.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.977
Sorry, chaps. I quoted you for
a 20 when it's a 40-footer.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.179

It's gonna be double bubble.

00:24:04.846 --> 00:24:06.681

A gentleman's quote
is a gentleman's word.

00:24:12.988 --> 00:24:16.725
Now, either you or your family are
gonna have to pay for that lesson.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.995
Do we have an understanding?

00:24:21.163 --> 00:24:22.330
Yes, boss.

00:24:23.632 --> 00:24:25.400
Give the soppy prick
his money.

00:24:29.004 --> 00:24:31.206
[Fletcher] Anyway,
let's put a pin in Dry Eye

00:24:31.339 --> 00:24:33.208
and turn again to Mickey.

00:24:33.675 --> 00:24:35.777
If you're thinking
of smoking that in here...

00:24:36.545 --> 00:24:37.479
don't.

00:24:37.646 --> 00:24:39.081
I find that confusing.

00:24:39.214 --> 00:24:42.451
Do you mean don't smoke
or don't think?

00:24:46.254 --> 00:24:47.889

a favor here, Mike,

to be finished this morning.

00:25:38.173 --> 00:25:41.176
- I'm not talking to you, Mike.
- Sorry, boss. Rodge is on the Range.

00:25:41.309 --> 00:25:44.045
How many times have I told you?
I don't want Roger up front.

00:25:44.179 --> 00:25:46.648
This is a sanctuary
for the ladies. Where is he?

00:25:46.781 --> 00:25:48.550

- [Mike] Of course I'm still fucking here.

00:26:03.798 --> 00:26:06.935
Right, well, if you're still there,
who's ordering the fucking parts?

00:26:07.235 --> 00:26:08.436

00:26:24.452 --> 00:26:25.854
I should have known
it was you behind this.

00:26:26.421 --> 00:26:27.889
Rodge is supposed to be
working down there

00:26:28.023 --> 00:26:29.491
and you're up here
blowing his brains out.

00:26:29.624 --> 00:26:31.459
- I'm on it, boss.
- You wanna be.

00:26:31.927 --> 00:26:33.461
Don't blame the Dodge,
dear.

You know he's got
a special nose

00:26:35.263 --> 00:26:37.098
and he's doing
this old dog a favor.

00:26:37.232 --> 00:26:38.668
Dodge, get down there
and earn your money.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.834
Gone.

00:26:42.704 --> 00:26:44.339
What you doing here anyway?

00:26:44.472 --> 00:26:46.676

a cup of tea with my wife.

00:26:47.342 --> 00:26:49.411
Well, go on, then.

00:26:51.846 --> 00:26:53.548

- Second thoughts?
- No second thoughts.

00:26:56.718 --> 00:26:58.386
I like middle age.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.890
I like gentrification,
private schools, fine wines

00:27:02.023 --> 00:27:05.760
and a spoonful of caviar
to help my medicine go down.

00:27:06.595 --> 00:27:09.998
But most importantly, I'm looking
forward to spending more time with you.

00:27:10.131 --> 00:27:11.199
Course you are.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.602
Look, I don't want you
knocking around here

00:27:13.735 --> 00:27:16.037
feeling all unemployed
and lost with yourself.

00:27:16.538 --> 00:27:17.939
Well, fuck me.

00:27:18.708 --> 00:27:20.242
Most wives would beg
their other halves

00:27:20.375 --> 00:27:22.177
to get out
of this game, but not you.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.778
That's because
I know you, darling.

00:27:24.879 --> 00:27:28.016
Look, you'll have to
do this elegantly, love.

00:27:28.684 --> 00:27:32.120
If word spreads that you're getting
out, that could read as weakness.

00:27:32.254 --> 00:27:34.422
And if you smell smoke,
it's 'cause there's a fire,

00:27:34.556 --> 00:27:36.726
and that could
get expensive.

00:27:36.858 --> 00:27:39.761
So you're gonna have to stamp that
out without any gentrification.

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:41.796
But not you, love.

00:27:43.633 --> 00:27:45.333

00:28:09.424 --> 00:28:11.059

wasting our time?

00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:14.062
I know what happens in my
world and what doesn't.

00:28:14.195 --> 00:28:17.299

why Michael should be motivated

00:28:17.432 --> 00:28:19.167
to write you
a check for 20 million.

00:28:19.301 --> 00:28:22.971
I find you very impatient, Raymond.
I am a storyteller.

00:28:23.104 --> 00:28:25.573
As they say in the film game,
I'm laying pipe.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.777
Well, you'd better put
something through it soon.

00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:30.312
So what is that?
Is that a barbecue as well?

00:28:32.113 --> 00:28:34.983
- Yes, it is, Fletcher.
- I love a barbie.

00:28:35.383 --> 00:28:37.152
That is a useful bit of plant,
then, isn't it?

00:28:37.285 --> 00:28:40.055
So that heats up your knees
and cooks at the same time?

00:28:40.188 --> 00:28:42.891
[chuckles] You gotta show me
how to get one of them.

00:28:43.024 --> 00:28:45.327
Well, you can take it with
you if you fuck off now.

Ray.

00:28:48.963 --> 00:28:50.332
Is there any chance
of a steak?

00:28:56.271 --> 00:29:00.041
Yeah, all right. Got a bit of
Wagyu in the freezer as it happens.

00:29:00.175 --> 00:29:03.646
- I've never had Wagyu.
- Yeah, well, it'll be wasted on you, but it's all I've got.

00:29:03.779 --> 00:29:05.715
- I'll get it, mate.
- Oh, no, you're all right.

00:29:05.847 --> 00:29:07.750
- Just stay right there.
- Oh.

00:29:10.218 --> 00:29:11.386
Ow, fuck me!

00:29:12.854 --> 00:29:13.955
It's hot.

00:29:20.028 --> 00:29:21.396
[exhales]

00:29:22.163 --> 00:29:25.200
He's a sly fox,
that Fletcher.

00:29:31.807 --> 00:29:33.341
Night-night, Aslan.

00:29:34.042 --> 00:29:35.877
32 LS engines?

00:29:36.344 --> 00:29:38.546
You got all these parts
on a 40-foot container?

00:29:39.514 --> 00:29:40.515
Yeah.

00:29:41.349 --> 00:29:42.550
How'd you get
your hands on that?

00:29:44.152 --> 00:29:46.254
Ask no questions,
hear no lies.

00:29:46.722 --> 00:29:47.757
Hence the price.

00:29:48.724 --> 00:29:50.760
- So how much?
- Oh, no charge.

00:29:50.892 --> 00:29:53.194
Okay, so what's the price?

00:29:53.328 --> 00:29:54.529
A meeting with your husband.

00:29:54.663 --> 00:29:56.297
[chuckles] Oh, fuck off.

00:29:56.431 --> 00:29:57.666
That's not gonna happen.

00:29:58.233 --> 00:29:59.601
It's in his interest.

00:30:01.837 --> 00:30:06.074
Tell you what, keep the parts.
Consider it a gesture of goodwill.

00:30:08.209 --> 00:30:09.879
You know
how to get hold of me.

00:30:11.546 --> 00:30:13.481
Well, I can't
promise anything.

00:30:13.615 --> 00:30:16.050
Dry Eye, he got his little
sit-down with Michael, didn't he?

00:30:16.918 --> 00:30:20.088
Bold move, that,
coming in heavy,

00:30:20.221 --> 00:30:23.525
sanctioned or unsanctioned...

00:30:24.526 --> 00:30:27.562
by the dragon head himself,
Lord George.

00:30:28.229 --> 00:30:30.465
Well, he's a naughty boy,
that George.

00:30:30.866 --> 00:30:33.636
But Dry Eye,
oh, he's next generation,

00:30:33.769 --> 00:30:36.938
and them Chinamen, they upgrade
quicker than i-fucking-Phones.

00:30:37.071 --> 00:30:38.373
Is he making moves?

00:30:38.506 --> 00:30:40.141
[chattering]

00:30:40.275 --> 00:30:42.110
[Fletcher]
Is he breaking out on his own?

00:30:42.243 --> 00:30:44.747
Big man plans
behind Lord George's back?

00:30:47.716 --> 00:30:51.519
To be fair, it was very nicely played
with 100 grand's worth of free car parts,

00:30:51.654 --> 00:30:56.124
because everyone knows that the way
to a man's heart is through his wife.

00:30:58.661 --> 00:31:00.528
You'd make a lovely wife,
Raymond.

00:31:11.072 --> 00:31:13.541
Thank you for taking the time
to see me, Michael.

00:31:14.409 --> 00:31:15.878
Lord George sends his best.

00:31:16.311 --> 00:31:19.047
I only took this meeting
because Ros asked me to.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.082
Make sure to never approach
her like that again.

00:31:21.717 --> 00:31:23.351
I meant no disrespect.

00:31:33.662 --> 00:31:34.763
How can I help?

00:31:35.931 --> 00:31:37.298
I understand
you're getting out.

00:31:38.466 --> 00:31:41.269
Getting out.
Getting out of what?

00:31:41.402 --> 00:31:43.505
Bed? My head?
The closet?

00:31:44.005 --> 00:31:46.140
Don't flirt with me, Dry Eye.
I'm a busy man.

00:31:46.742 --> 00:31:48.476
I hear you're
getting out of the game.

00:31:49.845 --> 00:31:52.915
And I would like you
to consider an offer.

00:31:53.047 --> 00:31:55.049
Look, I'm gonna stop you
right there

00:31:55.183 --> 00:31:57.151
so you don't waste any more of
your precious breath, young man.

00:31:57.285 --> 00:31:59.487
This is not a discussion
for the two of us.

00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:01.657
Unlike the salt and pepper,
it's not on the table.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.596
This is a big number.

00:32:09.999 --> 00:32:13.101
[typing on phone]

00:32:30.653 --> 00:32:31.720
Cash.

00:32:32.287 --> 00:32:35.758
I am not for sale.

00:32:37.993 --> 00:32:40.562
And even if I was,
you're several zeros short.

00:32:40.696 --> 00:32:42.898
Now, you may be able to buy
your man's sausage for that,

00:32:43.032 --> 00:32:45.366
but to me it just looks
rude at breakfast.

00:32:48.003 --> 00:32:49.070
You're out of touch.

00:32:52.206 --> 00:32:55.410
You're forgetting the laws of the
jungle, looking down on me.

00:33:00.582 --> 00:33:03.585
Now, when the silverback's
got more silver than back...

00:33:04.687 --> 00:33:05.955
he best move on...

00:33:08.122 --> 00:33:09.591
before he gets moved on.

00:33:10.759 --> 00:33:12.293
It's not dignified.

00:33:13.094 --> 00:33:16.932
It's beneath you, Michael.
Trying to do you a favor.

00:33:17.066 --> 00:33:18.266
[sighs]

00:33:18.968 --> 00:33:21.202
This is a big fucking number.

00:33:27.275 --> 00:33:28.711
And this?

00:33:29.544 --> 00:33:31.279
This is a big fucking gun.

00:33:35.183 --> 00:33:36.919
[groans]

00:33:38.386 --> 00:33:39.454
[squealing]

00:33:39.587 --> 00:33:41.222
Eyes not so dry now, are they?

00:33:41.356 --> 00:33:42.992
[screaming]

00:33:43.792 --> 00:33:44.927
Hurts, does it?

00:33:46.427 --> 00:33:48.631
You looking for your balls
or a hole in the wall?

00:33:48.764 --> 00:33:51.432
- Fuck!
- Where the fuck do you think you're going?

00:33:51.834 --> 00:33:55.169
Because you're not going out the way you
came in, you deluded duck-eating cunt.

00:33:55.303 --> 00:33:57.973
- [screams]
- Talking to me about the laws of the jungle.

00:33:58.107 --> 00:34:00.809
What was it? Something
about being beneath me?

00:34:00.943 --> 00:34:02.377
Silver on back?

00:34:03.578 --> 00:34:06.015
There's only one rule
in this fucking jungle.

00:34:06.447 --> 00:34:09.484
When the lion's hungry,
he eats.

00:34:11.285 --> 00:34:12.353
[Raymond]
You're wrong, Fletcher.

00:34:12.487 --> 00:34:14.155
That's not how Michael works.

00:34:14.288 --> 00:34:17.325
Yeah, I know. I know. I was
just having a bit of fun.

00:34:17.693 --> 00:34:19.560
Every movie needs
a bit of action, doesn't it?

00:34:19.695 --> 00:34:21.630
And it's not like Michael
doesn't have a reputation.

00:34:21.764 --> 00:34:23.498
Had a reputation.

00:34:24.133 --> 00:34:25.834
He's been gentrified.

00:34:26.635 --> 00:34:28.804
[audio rewinding]

00:34:30.839 --> 00:34:32.675
[Dry Eye]
...big fucking number.

00:34:33.241 --> 00:34:37.545
I know how you lot love fables,
so let me share a little fable with you.

00:34:39.114 --> 00:34:41.315
There once was
a young and foolish dragon

00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:43.686
who came to ask
a wise and cunning lion

00:34:43.819 --> 00:34:46.121
about acquiring
his territory.

00:34:46.254 --> 00:34:49.190
Now, the lion, he wasn't interested,
so he told the little dragon to fuck off.

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:53.062
But the dragon couldn't
understand what "fuck off" meant,

00:34:53.194 --> 00:34:56.031
so he persisted and
continued to ask the lion

00:34:56.165 --> 00:34:58.067
about acquiring
his territory.

00:34:58.199 --> 00:35:01.003
So the lion took
the little dragon for a walk

00:35:01.136 --> 00:35:03.839
and put five bullets
in his little dragon head.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.009
End of story.

00:35:09.645 --> 00:35:12.380
Now, allegedly
there's a message in there.

00:35:12.513 --> 00:35:15.684
I don't know what it is,
but you're a clever boy, Dry Eye.

00:35:15.818 --> 00:35:17.585
Maybe you can
explain it to me.

00:35:19.587 --> 00:35:21.389
I think your time's up,
chaps.

00:35:22.557 --> 00:35:24.727
Michael, you should recons...

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.894
[tuts]

00:35:27.395 --> 00:35:28.596
Just marinade on it.

00:35:30.065 --> 00:35:31.700
In the meantime, fuck off.

00:35:36.038 --> 00:35:39.373
Oh, I bet Mickey was pleased he
took that meeting, wasn't he?

00:35:39.507 --> 00:35:41.777
Yes, it went very well.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:43.946
- Yeah.
- Do you want the top or the bottom?

00:35:44.412 --> 00:35:46.048
The bottom, please, darling.

00:35:46.882 --> 00:35:49.517
Now, things started to unravel
after that meeting.

00:35:49.651 --> 00:35:52.553
Didn't Mickey get a rat
infestation at one of his farms?

00:35:58.794 --> 00:35:59.995
[man 1 whispering] Come on.

00:36:01.395 --> 00:36:02.463
Stealth, stealth.

00:36:03.932 --> 00:36:04.967
Go.

00:36:07.236 --> 00:36:08.569
Ballys down.

00:36:11.539 --> 00:36:13.474
Let's move. Go, go, go, go.

00:36:16.277 --> 00:36:17.278
[man 2] Shit.

00:36:17.713 --> 00:36:18.814
[man 3 laughs]

00:36:18.947 --> 00:36:21.750
Oh, my days.

00:36:22.316 --> 00:36:23.786
[man 1] Fucking hell.

00:36:24.418 --> 00:36:25.754
He said
there'd be a bit of puff.

00:36:25.888 --> 00:36:27.355
[man 3]
Yeah, they weren't joking.

00:36:28.857 --> 00:36:31.559
Oi, fellas.
It's already packed.

00:36:31.693 --> 00:36:32.895
Let's not mess about.

00:36:33.028 --> 00:36:34.328
Let's load it up, boys.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.464
Who the fuck are you lot?

00:36:36.597 --> 00:36:38.399
[man 1] Fuck. Cover up.

00:36:38.967 --> 00:36:40.334
Do you know
who owns this gaff?

00:36:40.736 --> 00:36:42.037
[man 1]
We don't give a fuck.

00:36:42.537 --> 00:36:44.072
I think you got off
on the wrong stop.

00:36:45.073 --> 00:36:46.407
Oi, Tezza!

00:36:46.541 --> 00:36:48.944
- [Tezza] What?
- Fancy a row?

00:36:51.079 --> 00:36:52.346
Who are these jokers?

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.816
They want our gear.

00:36:54.482 --> 00:36:55.583
Marv!

00:36:56.584 --> 00:36:57.686
Who's this cunt?

00:36:58.253 --> 00:36:59.387
John!

00:37:00.454 --> 00:37:02.523
Oh, hello.
It's Dad's Army.

00:37:02.658 --> 00:37:03.992
Oi, Frank.

00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:07.328
What's this?
Teddy bears' picnic?

00:37:07.461 --> 00:37:09.031
[Frank] Oi, Mo!

00:37:10.464 --> 00:37:12.333
Any more rabbits
in that warren?

00:37:12.466 --> 00:37:13.635
[man 1]

00:37:13.769 --> 00:37:14.970

Not for you Jelly Babies.

00:37:15.103 --> 00:37:16.305
[man 3] On three, lads.

00:37:16.939 --> 00:37:17.873
Three.

[chattering]

00:37:19.708 --> 00:37:21.076
[boy 1] Hey!

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.978
What? You wanna
call him back, Granddad?

00:37:23.879 --> 00:37:25.080
- [blows]
- Fuck!

00:37:25.681 --> 00:37:26.982
Boss, let me get
two burgers on the stove.

00:37:27.115 --> 00:37:28.183
Get that quick, understand?

00:37:28.317 --> 00:37:30.118
And I want two chips as well.

00:37:30.252 --> 00:37:32.221
What is this smell
of wee in here?

00:37:32.353 --> 00:37:33.521
[chattering stops]

00:37:34.488 --> 00:37:36.124
Who the fuck
is this joke, man?

00:37:36.258 --> 00:37:37.860
Don't stand near me, son.

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.230
You got your mouthwash
muddled up with cat piss.

00:37:41.697 --> 00:37:44.532
Take two steps back
and wait your turn.

00:37:44.666 --> 00:37:46.335
[boys chuckle]

00:37:47.135 --> 00:37:49.403
You better fuck off, old man,
or I'll wet you.

00:37:49.537 --> 00:37:51.640
The only thing you can wet's
your underpants, son.

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:53.242
Now, back two steps.

- [boy 1] Stick it in him, bruv.

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.585

- Don't, you know, dance.

I need some back and forth. Come on.

Now, make it quick. Make it funny.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.209

Jeez, that's disappointing.
No, no, not that.

00:38:31.013 --> 00:38:32.814
Go again. Go again.

00:38:32.948 --> 00:38:35.516

- [boy 3] Fucking do him, laddie.
- Come on.

00:38:37.386 --> 00:38:39.054
[boy 1] Yeah. Yeah.

- Oh, shit!

We'll see what we can do with yous.

Shit. It's the fucking coach,
bro. It's the fucking coach.

Ernie, what is it?

[Ernie over phone]
Ball's in the back of the net.

00:39:25.634 --> 00:39:28.804
We've rung the bell here and we're gonna
include you, because you're our mentor.

00:39:28.937 --> 00:39:31.605
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I don't like the sound of it.

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:35.444
- We've landed a load of sticky bush.
- Listen to me, now, Ernie.

00:39:35.576 --> 00:39:37.511
Walk away.

00:39:37.646 --> 00:39:39.715
It's too late. We're at
the gym now unloading the van.

00:39:39.848 --> 00:39:41.083
You took my van?

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:43.819
Wait there.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

I've gotta say,
I was impressed.

The way they fought?
They're on point, guvnor.

Thank you.
That's enough.

- Well, I'm just saying.
- Well, quit saying.

00:42:07.295 --> 00:42:08.763
Okay, thank you.

Doesn't feel like
a coincidence, does it?

00:42:20.242 --> 00:42:22.310
It isn't.
There's fuckery afoot.

00:42:23.245 --> 00:42:25.547
- How did they find it?
- I don't know.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.948
I'm making inquiries.

00:42:28.183 --> 00:42:29.818
What about Matthew?

00:42:29.951 --> 00:42:31.286
He's gonna need reassuring

00:42:31.419 --> 00:42:33.021
before he parts
with 400 big ones.

00:42:33.155 --> 00:42:35.056
[Fletcher] So many questions
unanswered, Ray.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:38.960
I mean, who'd be smart enough
to find one of Mickey's farms?

00:42:39.094 --> 00:42:40.162
Apart from me, of course.

00:42:41.029 --> 00:42:44.966
And who would be bold enough
to make such a move?

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.003
Especially to film it all
and then post it all online?

00:42:48.136 --> 00:42:51.706
Because that is really rubbing
your face in it, isn't it?

00:42:52.507 --> 00:42:53.675
[Matthew]
I'm here to help, Michael.

00:42:53.808 --> 00:42:56.278
I'm your friend, your ally,

00:42:56.411 --> 00:42:58.346
your Santa Claus
for all seasons,

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.284
and I'd like you to know my team
of elves can be very persuasive.

00:43:02.684 --> 00:43:06.388
Persuasive? And why
would I need persuasive?

00:43:06.521 --> 00:43:09.891
Well, I hear you might have
had a little trouble.

00:43:10.759 --> 00:43:12.827
Now, you helped me before
when my source ran dry,

00:43:12.961 --> 00:43:15.397
so I'm just returning
the favor and reminding you

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:17.098
I have effectual friends.

00:43:17.232 --> 00:43:18.500
Elves?

00:43:19.067 --> 00:43:20.335
Elves?

00:43:20.468 --> 00:43:23.238
- Yes. You said elves.
- Did I?

00:43:23.371 --> 00:43:24.406
Mm.

00:43:25.173 --> 00:43:28.678
No trouble over here, Matthew.
No trouble at all.

00:43:31.413 --> 00:43:32.814
So we brought you
a token.

00:43:32.948 --> 00:43:34.082
[Mickey] You did?

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:39.554
And what might this be?

00:43:39.689 --> 00:43:43.091
It's a paperweight to keep down all
the paper I'm about to give you.

00:43:43.225 --> 00:43:46.161
- Well, it looks like a gun.
- And it's a paperweight.

00:43:46.294 --> 00:43:50.599
Seeing how in this country,
unlike in our homeland, they're illegal.

So is riding your bicycle
at night without lights.

00:43:53.468 --> 00:43:55.070
Laws are there
as a guideline.

00:43:55.203 --> 00:43:57.839
In France, it's illegal
to call a pig Napoleon,

00:43:57.973 --> 00:43:59.341
but just try and stop me.

00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:03.511
I quite like it.
You're very kind.

00:44:03.646 --> 00:44:06.181
- Thank you.
- Hands across the sea.

00:44:06.314 --> 00:44:08.350
[Fletcher]
Mickey calmed down the Jew

00:44:08.483 --> 00:44:10.085
and it seems the deal
is still going ahead.

00:44:10.552 --> 00:44:14.122
But bad timing, jeopardizing
deals, shutting down farms.

00:44:14.256 --> 00:44:18.293
It could be an expensive disaster if
Mickey doesn't get this cleaned up.

00:44:18.728 --> 00:44:20.495
[man] Should I be scared?

00:44:21.796 --> 00:44:25.333
[Mickey] I don't think so,
but I like to err on the side of caution.

00:44:25.467 --> 00:44:26.968
What does that mean?

00:44:27.102 --> 00:44:28.970
It means I'm going to
have to close shop,

00:44:29.104 --> 00:44:32.173
shut this farm down
and make it disappear.

00:44:32.607 --> 00:44:34.075
You might see
a couple of trucks around here

00:44:34.209 --> 00:44:35.944
over the next few days,
but that's it.

00:44:36.077 --> 00:44:38.179
Well, I'm not gonna pretend
that missing out

00:44:38.313 --> 00:44:41.349
on a million pounds commission a
year isn't going to hurt somewhat.

00:44:41.483 --> 00:44:43.084
The pain is being shared.

00:44:43.218 --> 00:44:46.621
Stolen product,
loss of earnings meantime,

00:44:46.756 --> 00:44:49.824
the cost of shutting down,
the expense of setting up elsewhere.

00:44:50.558 --> 00:44:52.427
It's funny, really, but
it couldn't be worse timing.

00:44:52.762 --> 00:44:54.062
How so?

00:44:54.195 --> 00:44:55.430
I've...

00:44:56.598 --> 00:44:58.900
I've just learned we need
a whole new roof apparently.

00:44:59.034 --> 00:45:02.337
As I say, I'm as upset
about this as you are.

00:45:06.941 --> 00:45:09.010
- Henry.
- Mickey.

00:45:09.745 --> 00:45:13.581
[Fletcher] The toffs look after Mickey.
Now Mickey looks after the toffs.

00:45:14.249 --> 00:45:16.786
But there's a lot of toffs
to look after.

00:45:17.619 --> 00:45:19.621
- Henry.
- [Fletcher] And when it rains...

00:45:19.755 --> 00:45:21.156
Let me take care of the roof.

00:45:21.289 --> 00:45:23.525
[Fletcher]
...it fucking pours.

00:45:24.025 --> 00:45:27.062
Now, there's only one thing that
needs more looking after than a toff,

00:45:27.195 --> 00:45:29.665
and that is
a toff's offspring.

00:45:29.799 --> 00:45:33.068
Which brings me neatly back
to Big Dave's story,

00:45:33.201 --> 00:45:35.705
the very reason I'm sitting
here sipping whiskey with you

00:45:35.837 --> 00:45:37.572
in the first fucking place.

00:45:37.707 --> 00:45:41.242
This is how Big Dave
is gonna bring Mickey down,

00:45:41.376 --> 00:45:45.547
by using and abusing Lord
Pressfield's much-beloved child.

00:45:45.681 --> 00:45:50.485
Lord Pressfield's daughter, the famous and
talented Laura, all self-hate and harm,

00:45:50.618 --> 00:45:53.888
has fallen for this Power
Noel's smacked-out dark charm,

00:45:54.022 --> 00:45:55.691
and I want the lot of them,

00:45:56.257 --> 00:45:59.060
especially that
slimy little jam rag Pearson,

00:45:59.194 --> 00:46:01.731
in bed with a skint,
discredited toff,

00:46:01.863 --> 00:46:05.567
and supplying gear to young
and reckless rock-star royals,

00:46:05.701 --> 00:46:07.969
royals unbridled
by distracted parents

00:46:08.103 --> 00:46:10.171
too busy skiing
on the Swiss Alps to notice

00:46:10.305 --> 00:46:12.040
and too fucking stupid
to care.

00:46:12.173 --> 00:46:14.876
[chuckles] I like it.
You're good at this, boss.

00:46:15.009 --> 00:46:17.011
Yeah, I know what I'm good at,
Hammy. Fuck off.

00:46:18.012 --> 00:46:22.584
Aristocratic, junkie, bulimic,
auto-tuned singing daughter

00:46:22.718 --> 00:46:25.253
shacked up with some smacked-out,
once-upon-a-time pop star,

00:46:25.387 --> 00:46:27.055
and all looked after
by Mickey Pearson.

00:46:27.188 --> 00:46:30.191
I like it.
You know, I like it a lot.

00:46:30.892 --> 00:46:32.560
We wrapped her
in cotton wool.

00:46:32.695 --> 00:46:34.596
But she was
our little Lor-la.

00:46:36.131 --> 00:46:39.000
Charlie called her that because
she couldn't say Laura at first.

00:46:39.702 --> 00:46:41.403
We miss her terribly, Mickey.

00:46:42.504 --> 00:46:44.105
I've failed as a parent.

00:46:44.239 --> 00:46:46.307
You mustn't keep
beating yourself up, dear.

00:46:46.441 --> 00:46:49.310
Anne's right, Charles.
You mustn't blame yourselves.

00:46:49.444 --> 00:46:51.346
It sounds as though Laura
fell in with the wrong crowd

00:46:51.479 --> 00:46:53.948
at a time when she was
particularly vulnerable.

00:46:54.082 --> 00:46:55.684
What more
could we do?

00:46:56.918 --> 00:46:58.620
It's happened
to so many of our friends.

00:46:58.754 --> 00:47:00.221
It's a curse.

00:47:01.556 --> 00:47:04.092
- Do you mind if I look into it?
- So you'll help us?

00:47:05.728 --> 00:47:07.262
Let me see what I can do.

00:47:11.667 --> 00:47:13.636
You should get yourself
one of these, boss.

00:47:13.769 --> 00:47:15.403
Well, that's the plan.

00:47:15.537 --> 00:47:17.038
Everything all right?

00:47:17.539 --> 00:47:18.874
You remember
their daughter?

00:47:19.007 --> 00:47:20.942
Yeah, Laura.
Nice girl. Good voice.

00:47:21.075 --> 00:47:24.612
Teeny sort of spunk-funk fuck pop.
Shame about the habit.

00:47:24.747 --> 00:47:28.016
She's gone missing. They've asked
us to find her, bring her home.

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:29.517
Mm-hmm.

00:47:30.251 --> 00:47:31.754
Is that a problem?

00:47:31.887 --> 00:47:33.488
Well, I had a feeling
you might ask me this, boss,

00:47:33.621 --> 00:47:35.190
so I did some due diligence.

00:47:35.323 --> 00:47:37.025
I know where she is
and I don't like it.

00:47:37.158 --> 00:47:39.461
- I'd rather we didn't get involved.
- Why not?

00:47:39.961 --> 00:47:41.963
[Raymond] She's on
a South London council estate.

00:47:42.096 --> 00:47:44.365
- [Mickey] So?
- It's out of our jurisdiction.

00:47:44.767 --> 00:47:46.802
There's too many moving parts,
parts that we can't control.

00:47:46.936 --> 00:47:48.771
What if she doesn't wanna come?
It's gonna get messy.

00:47:48.904 --> 00:47:51.606
Well, that may be true,
but you're still doing it.

00:47:52.641 --> 00:47:53.975
I accept that.

00:47:55.143 --> 00:47:56.511
But can't you
send Frazier instead?

00:47:56.645 --> 00:47:58.346
No, I can't
send Frazier instead.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.815
You're my best man.
I want you.

00:47:59.949 --> 00:48:01.349
[sighs]

00:48:06.387 --> 00:48:07.989
It's just that
I don't like smackies.

00:48:08.122 --> 00:48:10.158
It's the filth and the grime
and the grub in the tub.

00:48:10.291 --> 00:48:13.194
I'm not asking your OCD to spend
the weekend with them, Ray.

00:48:14.797 --> 00:48:16.364
Think of it
as philanthropy.

00:48:17.833 --> 00:48:19.200
Come on,
you're driving.

00:48:20.568 --> 00:48:22.537
No good deed
goes unpunished.

00:48:22.671 --> 00:48:26.742
[chuckles] And this is where you
have your moment, isn't it, Raymondo?

00:48:26.876 --> 00:48:28.543
This is where
you step on stage

00:48:28.677 --> 00:48:31.012
and set the dominoes flying
every-fucking-where.

00:48:32.146 --> 00:48:33.414
Meaning what?

00:48:33.548 --> 00:48:37.085
Meaning no good deed
goes unpunished.

00:48:37.519 --> 00:48:38.888
Knock, knock-knock,
knock, knock.

00:48:48.062 --> 00:48:49.364
Buenos dias.

00:48:50.198 --> 00:48:51.266
[man] Wrong door.

00:48:51.399 --> 00:48:52.567
[Raymond] Ah, ah, ah.

00:48:53.736 --> 00:48:57.138
My name is Raymond Smith.

00:48:58.139 --> 00:49:00.174
Can I step inside
for a moment, please?

00:49:06.614 --> 00:49:08.149
How can I help you,
Officer?

00:49:09.217 --> 00:49:12.420
I'm not the police. No, I just
need a moment of your time.

00:49:12.554 --> 00:49:14.556
It's about Laura Pressfield.

00:49:15.958 --> 00:49:17.492
I don't know anyone
of that name.

00:49:18.293 --> 00:49:20.595
It would be much easier
for all parties concerned

00:49:20.729 --> 00:49:22.865
if I could just step inside
for a moment.

00:49:23.632 --> 00:49:24.867
No, fuck off.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.835
[boy 1] Jeez.

00:49:27.402 --> 00:49:28.871
[boy 2]
That's a nice whip, bruv.

00:49:29.337 --> 00:49:31.539
Killer motor. It's a shame
about them rims, though.

00:49:31.674 --> 00:49:32.975
[boy 2]
Yeah, lend us the keys.

00:49:33.107 --> 00:49:34.944
Put some chrome twenty-twos
on that.

00:49:35.076 --> 00:49:37.445
Hey, my man's got the Dessies
and the bootcuts, you know.

00:49:37.579 --> 00:49:39.280
Deffo linking a jessie.

00:49:39.782 --> 00:49:40.950
[elevator bell dings]

00:49:42.183 --> 00:49:44.252
[muffled chattering]

00:49:54.063 --> 00:49:55.396
[man 1] What the fuck?

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:57.498
[speakers: rock music playing]

00:49:57.633 --> 00:50:00.101
[chattering]

00:50:00.903 --> 00:50:03.438
- [man 1] What are you doing here?
- [man 2] Now, now, now.

00:50:04.172 --> 00:50:06.742
- [man 1] Get the fuck out.
- Now, now, now.

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:09.912
[speakers:
music continues playing]

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.248
As you was, boys and girls.

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.629
Sit down.

00:50:31.599 --> 00:50:32.801
Thank you.

00:50:37.505 --> 00:50:39.607
Shall we have
a little bit of fresh air?

00:50:40.776 --> 00:50:41.810
[music stops]

00:50:44.813 --> 00:50:46.949
Who the fuck
are your mates, Brown?

00:50:47.082 --> 00:50:50.786
No need to get excited, young man.
We will be gone in a few moments.

00:50:50.919 --> 00:50:53.488
No, no, no, you'll be gone before then.
Get the fuck out now.

00:50:56.659 --> 00:50:58.861
I can be dangerous if I want to be.
Get the fuck out now.

00:50:58.994 --> 00:51:02.765
Sit down, Power,
before you get yourself into more trouble.

00:51:02.898 --> 00:51:05.299
How d'you know my name? How
the fuck does he know my name?

00:51:05.433 --> 00:51:07.036
I know all your names.

00:51:07.736 --> 00:51:10.973
Apart from
that little anomaly.

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.809
I know where
you went to school.

00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:16.779
I know who your parents are.

00:51:16.912 --> 00:51:21.449
And I know you'll suck a
cock for a five-pound bag.

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.955
Now sit.

00:51:35.864 --> 00:51:38.867
Just so we're clear,
I work for a man,

00:51:39.534 --> 00:51:41.170
a powerful man.

00:51:41.536 --> 00:51:42.503
Michael Pearson.

00:51:42.638 --> 00:51:44.205
Ten points to you, Laura.

00:51:44.338 --> 00:51:45.674
Who's Michael Pearson?

00:51:46.041 --> 00:51:49.210
Friend of her father's.
Runs London's puff game.

00:51:49.343 --> 00:51:50.679
A big dick swinger.

00:51:51.146 --> 00:51:52.513
What is your name,
young man?

00:51:53.481 --> 00:51:55.718
- Aslan.
- And where are you from, Aslan?

00:51:55.851 --> 00:51:57.786
You don't sound like
one of the natives.

00:51:58.386 --> 00:51:59.587
Disneyland.

00:51:59.722 --> 00:52:01.289
Sounds about right.

00:52:01.824 --> 00:52:03.558
Well, you are correct.
He is a big dick swinger.

00:52:03.692 --> 00:52:06.028
But I wouldn't want him
to hear you say that.

00:52:06.161 --> 00:52:09.898
It's best you forget what he apparently
does for a living after we depart.

00:52:10.733 --> 00:52:14.103
Now, Laura, your father's
asked us to bring you home.

00:52:14.235 --> 00:52:15.536
She's not going anywhere.

00:52:24.913 --> 00:52:26.181
Do you mind if I sit?

00:52:26.314 --> 00:52:27.548
Yes.

00:52:37.525 --> 00:52:42.765
[sighs] I don't build a joint like
the Americans and the new school...

00:52:43.464 --> 00:52:47.236
back-strapping, jockstrapping,
coke-wrapping, and all that bollocks.

00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:50.739
I like a good old-fashioned
50-50 mix, me.

00:52:51.206 --> 00:52:52.674
That's how we used to play.

00:52:53.274 --> 00:52:55.077
If there's one thing
I will never understand,

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:57.311
it's why you lot
get addicted to heroin.

00:52:57.913 --> 00:53:01.750
If there's one drug you should not
chase, it is the dirty dragon.

00:53:02.651 --> 00:53:04.186
Did you ever
give it a spin, Bunny?

00:53:04.318 --> 00:53:07.156
No, not me, Ray.
I don't even puff anymore.

00:53:07.288 --> 00:53:11.325
Of course not. Bunny likes the gym.
You can probably see that.

00:53:12.227 --> 00:53:15.164
- What are you benching these days?
- Three wheels a side.

00:53:16.064 --> 00:53:17.266
What about you, Brown?

00:53:17.699 --> 00:53:20.903
What about me?
[stammers] What could I lift?

00:53:21.569 --> 00:53:24.273
You couldn't lift
a wheel of cheese, you cunt.

00:53:27.743 --> 00:53:28.977
Now...

00:53:30.879 --> 00:53:32.781
if you wanna be naughty,

00:53:32.915 --> 00:53:35.951
what happened to a little smoke
and a poke and a glass of wine,

00:53:36.084 --> 00:53:38.319
some Barry White,
candles around the bath

00:53:38.452 --> 00:53:39.988
and put your finger
in the missus?

00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:42.224
Who's Barry White?

00:53:42.858 --> 00:53:44.293
[Bunny] Big black geezer.

00:53:44.425 --> 00:53:45.694
Sexy voice.

00:53:45.828 --> 00:53:47.629
I'm... I'm lost.

00:53:47.763 --> 00:53:51.465
Am I in the bath with Barry
White's finger in my missus?

00:53:51.867 --> 00:53:55.971
Be quiet, Brown. You were lost
long before Barry White walked in.

00:54:07.883 --> 00:54:09.818
If you lot are unhappy,

00:54:09.952 --> 00:54:12.486
you should share your thoughts
with your friends.

00:54:13.121 --> 00:54:16.357
Nice friends. Talk it out,
find a positive solution.

00:54:16.959 --> 00:54:21.029
But, no,
all you lot choose squalor.

00:54:21.997 --> 00:54:24.532
Drowning in
your liberal white guilt.

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.302
Sorry,
what am I guilty of?

00:54:27.435 --> 00:54:29.503
Being a cunt, Brown.

00:54:30.839 --> 00:54:32.373
Being a cunt.

00:54:33.842 --> 00:54:35.844
Anyway, I'm not your shrink.

00:54:35.978 --> 00:54:38.180
I'm just trying to radiate
some positive vibes man to man.

00:54:38.313 --> 00:54:40.849
I mean, that's what this puff
game used to be all about.

00:54:44.319 --> 00:54:45.687
Anyway...

00:54:47.856 --> 00:54:49.091
back to you, Laura,

00:54:49.224 --> 00:54:52.393
queen in this here
kingdom of shit.

00:54:52.995 --> 00:54:56.865
A single rose
in a cauldron of thorns.

00:54:58.599 --> 00:55:00.235
Are you ready
to turn the corner?

00:55:01.236 --> 00:55:03.404
Open the curtains
and let the light in?

00:55:03.872 --> 00:55:06.775
Do your mum and dad a favor
and try the impossible,

00:55:07.376 --> 00:55:09.211
make yourself happy.

00:55:15.516 --> 00:55:16.550
All right.

00:55:17.252 --> 00:55:19.453
Fucking hell.
That was easy.

00:55:20.588 --> 00:55:22.190
All right, fantastic.

00:55:22.324 --> 00:55:23.926
Well, in that case, Bunny,

00:55:24.059 --> 00:55:26.194
will you help Laura
with her things, please?

00:55:26.328 --> 00:55:28.063
Incoming.

00:55:28.196 --> 00:55:30.098
It's all right, Bunny.
I don't really have anything.

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.273
It's a shithole anyway.

00:55:41.643 --> 00:55:42.978
Don't go. Please, wait!

00:55:44.079 --> 00:55:45.747
[grunts]

00:55:45.881 --> 00:55:47.115
Sit down!

00:55:49.084 --> 00:55:52.154
Touch me again,
I'll cut your fucking arm off.

00:55:52.287 --> 00:55:53.822
[panting]

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:57.426
It's all right, Bunny.
Keep going.

00:55:58.727 --> 00:56:02.097
I just will not be
manhandled by a junkie cunt.

00:56:06.401 --> 00:56:10.973
Dave, keep the kids in
school for one minute.

00:56:15.377 --> 00:56:17.245
[boy 1] My man
probably wants to buy weed.

00:56:17.379 --> 00:56:20.349
- What, da Loud Pack, boss?
- [boy 2] Or the Purple Haze then.

00:56:20.481 --> 00:56:22.483
[boy 3] My man just pulled out
a donkey choker, bruv.

00:56:22.616 --> 00:56:24.152
Keep your puff.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:28.589
Buy yourself a sticky book
and a packet of sweets.

00:56:28.724 --> 00:56:29.825
[boy 2] All-in!

00:56:31.126 --> 00:56:32.361
Now, now, now.

00:56:33.462 --> 00:56:34.429
[Aslan grunts]

00:56:34.562 --> 00:56:36.098
You cunt.

00:56:36.732 --> 00:56:38.300
[Brown] Fuck you! [grunts]

00:56:38.433 --> 00:56:41.136
Hey, that is
a naughty kettle, bruv.

00:56:41.269 --> 00:56:42.536
Hey, what's the time,
Mr. Wolf?

00:56:42.671 --> 00:56:46.641
It's time for you
to fuck off, lads.

00:56:46.775 --> 00:56:49.311
- [Brown coughing]
- [Power] Fucking hit him, Brown!

00:56:49.444 --> 00:56:51.213
- [Dave grunts]
- [Aslan screams]

00:56:52.613 --> 00:56:55.117
Ah. He's bought you a gun.

00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:57.252
That's a nice little gift.

00:56:57.386 --> 00:56:59.654
Five years in prison
all in one little box.

00:56:59.788 --> 00:57:02.657
Oh, but that's not a gun,
dear. That's a paperweight.

00:57:02.791 --> 00:57:06.928
Course it is, along with a
family of six baby bullets.

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:09.664
Guess we'll have to
get rid of that.

00:57:10.665 --> 00:57:12.701
- Hello, Ray.
- Rosalind.

00:57:13.068 --> 00:57:14.369
Sorry for the interruption.

00:57:14.503 --> 00:57:16.004
What do you need, Ray?

00:57:16.138 --> 00:57:18.640
Laura Pressfield
has been returned home safely.

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:26.515
Good.

00:57:29.051 --> 00:57:30.185
What else?

00:57:31.219 --> 00:57:33.255
One of her associates
had an accident.

00:57:34.622 --> 00:57:37.092
- Shit.
- He fell out of a window, boss.

00:57:37.225 --> 00:57:38.559
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

00:57:38.693 --> 00:57:42.197
It's time for you
to fuck off, lads.

00:57:44.332 --> 00:57:45.566
[boy 1] Oh, shit.

00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:47.302
Sounds like
quite an extreme accident.

00:57:47.436 --> 00:57:49.638
Yeah, it was more like
a death, really.

00:57:49.771 --> 00:57:51.139
[camera shutter clicking]

00:57:51.273 --> 00:57:53.308
- Oh, shit.
- [boy 2] Selfie, bruv!

00:57:53.442 --> 00:57:54.575
So you killed someone?

00:57:55.177 --> 00:57:57.245
No. It was the gravity
that killed him.

00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.815
- Who was he?
- Aslan.

00:57:59.948 --> 00:58:02.250
Some Russian kid
with tracks on his arms.

00:58:02.384 --> 00:58:04.152
Russian kid?
That doesn't sound good.

00:58:04.286 --> 00:58:05.320
Anyone see you?

00:58:05.454 --> 00:58:07.122
Little selfie? Selfie, bruv?

00:58:07.255 --> 00:58:08.423
[Raymond] Shit.

00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:10.826
Nothing was recorded.
We left it clean.

00:58:11.093 --> 00:58:13.462
- The body?
- I've dealt with that.

00:58:15.197 --> 00:58:17.732
- This is not ideal.
- It is not.

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.936
[Mickey] You can't be fooled
by how those junkies dress.

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:24.706
- They went to schools, expensive schools.
- Aslan.

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.275
[Mickey] Their parents
have money, lots of money.

00:58:28.443 --> 00:58:30.445
And money can be a problem.

00:58:31.947 --> 00:58:33.448
Shit.

00:58:33.582 --> 00:58:36.318
I bet you told Mickey nothing
about what happened.

00:58:36.852 --> 00:58:40.055
You're fishing, Fletcher,
because you've got no idea.

00:58:40.188 --> 00:58:43.058
You're right, I am fishing.

00:58:43.191 --> 00:58:47.262
Look at this. I'm fishing
in my little baggie.

00:58:48.296 --> 00:58:49.764
And what have I found?

00:58:51.399 --> 00:58:52.467
Oh.

00:58:52.601 --> 00:58:54.870
Thank you.
Or should I say...

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:56.805
spasibo?

00:58:57.172 --> 00:58:58.607
What's that young man
doing?

00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:00.575
Is he looking for
something on the floor?

00:59:01.076 --> 00:59:02.477
[Raymond] Frazier.

00:59:03.111 --> 00:59:05.614
Lads, we're gonna
need those phones.

00:59:06.281 --> 00:59:08.049
Hey, run. Move, bruv. Move.

00:59:08.183 --> 00:59:10.452
Bunny, get him.
Fucking clean that up.

to do with the fact I'm a cunt.

were cunts, Ernie.

very understanding.

they've had hard lives and they're
just starting to come good,

my responsibility,

01:06:06.735 --> 01:06:08.904
so it's me that should be
accountable for their actions.

[announcer speaking Chinese]

01:09:03.846 --> 01:09:05.681
[announcer
continues in Chinese]

01:09:05.814 --> 01:09:07.515
- [door opens]
- [chimes jingle]

01:09:13.055 --> 01:09:14.156
Lord George.

01:09:14.757 --> 01:09:16.125
Mr. Pearson.

01:09:17.592 --> 01:09:19.094
And to what do I owe?

01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:29.171
[sighs]

01:09:30.939 --> 01:09:32.007
What you watching?

01:09:33.307 --> 01:09:34.810
I'm watching the telly.

01:09:35.376 --> 01:09:37.112
What you watching
on the telly?

01:09:37.246 --> 01:09:39.748
I'm watching
the horse racing.

01:09:40.215 --> 01:09:43.652
Live satellite
from Hong Kong.

01:09:44.619 --> 01:09:46.221
My only vice.

01:09:46.354 --> 01:09:48.724
Well, that's not
strictly true, is it?

01:09:49.224 --> 01:09:50.893
Meaning?

01:09:51.026 --> 01:09:54.495
Meaning I've always taken vice
to be the definition

01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:57.598
of any criminal activity
or wicked behavior

01:09:57.733 --> 01:10:00.501
involving prostitution,
pornography or drugs,

01:10:00.636 --> 01:10:02.905
so, no...

01:10:03.972 --> 01:10:07.276
racing is definitely not
your only vice, your lordship.

01:10:07.408 --> 01:10:10.344
I'd say you're eyebrows deep
in every vice known to man.

01:10:10.478 --> 01:10:12.580
- There is a difference.
- Being?

01:10:13.215 --> 01:10:19.554
I facilitate. I don't participate
in any of the aforementioned vices.

01:10:22.124 --> 01:10:23.225
What about tea?

01:10:32.701 --> 01:10:33.869
[sighs]

01:10:34.002 --> 01:10:35.369
What about tea?

01:10:35.503 --> 01:10:38.640
Well, that too is a vice.

01:10:39.641 --> 01:10:41.509
Caffeine is a drug,
don't you know?

01:10:41.643 --> 01:10:45.479
So is that what you're here
to talk to me about? Tea?

01:10:45.613 --> 01:10:49.417
Sweet Mary Jane is my vice
of choice, as you well know.

01:10:49.852 --> 01:10:53.121
Of course, I'm addicted to
selling it, not consuming it.

01:10:53.487 --> 01:10:56.725
I specifically chose
to deal in marijuana.

01:10:57.159 --> 01:10:59.061
Sure, I could see
there was more to be made

01:10:59.194 --> 01:11:02.798
in shifting the white or the brown
powder, as you so chose,

01:11:02.931 --> 01:11:07.468
but, you see, my jam,
it doesn't kill anyone,

01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:09.570
and I like that.

01:11:11.974 --> 01:11:13.642
While your poison...

01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:19.447
is and always has been
a destroyer of worlds.

01:11:27.656 --> 01:11:32.728
So, yes, your facilitation is
most definitely participation.

01:11:42.905 --> 01:11:45.941
But I'm not here to give you a
sermon on situational ethics.

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:49.344
So why the fuck
are you here?

01:11:49.477 --> 01:11:50.779
[stomach gurgling]

01:11:53.315 --> 01:11:54.615
[gags]

01:11:56.218 --> 01:11:57.252
[groans]

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.596
You're starting a war
with me, George,

01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:10.431
and I'm trying to moonwalk
with elegance here,

01:12:10.564 --> 01:12:12.466
but I'm finding it
very fucking difficult.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.136
[Lord Pressfield] Laura!

01:12:14.269 --> 01:12:15.938
[Lord George]
I don't fuck around with puff.

01:12:16.071 --> 01:12:18.106
You send your man Dry Eye
around my place

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.075
to see if he can buy
my business for a few beans.

01:12:20.208 --> 01:12:21.276
Laura!

01:12:23.477 --> 01:12:25.347
[Mickey] You didn't
think I'd find out?

01:12:25.479 --> 01:12:27.349
Having me followed
for months?

01:12:28.616 --> 01:12:30.919
- [Lord George choking]
- Yeah. You crossed the line,

01:12:31.053 --> 01:12:32.620
and that comes
with a price.

01:12:33.221 --> 01:12:35.157
You raided
one of my locations.

01:12:35.891 --> 01:12:37.659
You know the rules,
George.

01:12:38.459 --> 01:12:39.962
What the fuck
were you thinking?

01:12:40.095 --> 01:12:41.930
You raided one of
my locations.

01:12:42.064 --> 01:12:43.932
What the fuck
were you thinking?

01:12:44.299 --> 01:12:46.335
What the fuck
were you thinking, George?

01:12:57.478 --> 01:12:58.512
[exhales]

01:13:00.082 --> 01:13:02.451
[sobbing]

01:13:11.626 --> 01:13:13.128
[breathing heavily]

01:13:13.261 --> 01:13:14.663
[exhales]

01:13:15.596 --> 01:13:18.300
[Lord George chokes, gasps]

01:13:22.603 --> 01:13:25.707
Should you
try and undermine me,

01:13:26.441 --> 01:13:29.177
or should you attempt
to threaten my position again,

01:13:29.311 --> 01:13:31.913
I will be forced to accept
your call to arms.

01:13:32.047 --> 01:13:33.248
Do you understand?

01:13:33.382 --> 01:13:34.916
[breathing heavily]

01:13:35.717 --> 01:13:36.818
Good.

01:13:38.186 --> 01:13:41.857
Now, I can see you're feeling
somewhat under the weather.

01:13:42.357 --> 01:13:44.059
That's because
I spiked your tea

01:13:44.192 --> 01:13:46.995
with a nasty little parasitic
genus called shigella.

01:13:47.829 --> 01:13:51.333
Left unattended, you will shit yourself
to death before the sun doth set.

01:13:53.101 --> 01:13:55.070
I suggest taking
two of these fizzy biscuits.

01:13:57.538 --> 01:13:59.241
You'll be fine
in an hour or two,

01:13:59.841 --> 01:14:02.144
long enough to consider
your past indiscretions.

01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:11.753
And, George, if I can get to
you in your own kitchen...

01:14:13.388 --> 01:14:14.489
I can get to you anywhere.

01:14:22.697 --> 01:14:25.367
- Did you do it?
- Do what?

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.969
Did you raid
Mickey Pearson's farm?

01:14:28.103 --> 01:14:32.207
- No.
- So you're telling me that Phuc did this behind your back.

01:14:33.075 --> 01:14:35.844
Well, let's just say this.
He didn't do it in front of it.

01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:37.712
He did it
without my blessing.

01:14:37.846 --> 01:14:39.414
But you did go behind my back

01:14:39.548 --> 01:14:41.316
and offer to buy his business.

01:14:43.351 --> 01:14:45.987
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

01:14:48.423 --> 01:14:50.659
Now, let me warn you
the way you warn me.

01:14:51.592 --> 01:14:55.464
There comes a point where
the young succeed the old.

01:14:56.565 --> 01:14:57.732
Don't push me.

01:15:02.237 --> 01:15:03.872
There are some things
I don't know about.

01:15:04.005 --> 01:15:07.109
Something between Dry Eye
and Lord George.

01:15:07.242 --> 01:15:12.547
Now, whatever it was,
someone killed Lord George.

01:15:13.014 --> 01:15:17.452
Anyone else might think
that was you or Mickey.

01:15:19.921 --> 01:15:22.057
Shall we continue
with our little story?

01:15:23.725 --> 01:15:25.794
Does that arouse
your interest, Raymond?

01:15:26.428 --> 01:15:27.929
[Raymond]
So Matthew knows Dry Eye.

01:15:29.264 --> 01:15:31.299
- So what?
- Well, yes, I agree.

01:15:31.433 --> 01:15:32.801
Perhaps they were
just meeting up

01:15:32.934 --> 01:15:34.536
to talk about holidaying
in the Maldives

01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:38.507
or the long-term implications
of leaving the EU.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.512
But I filmed it, had it lip-read,
translated and transcribed.

01:15:43.645 --> 01:15:46.615
Rather like the classic
1974 film The Conversation,

01:15:46.748 --> 01:15:49.117
starring Gene Hackman
and John Cazale.

01:15:49.251 --> 01:15:52.554
You know, Coppola slipped that
one out between the Godfathers.

01:15:53.121 --> 01:15:55.457
It wasn't really for me.
It's a bit boring, to be honest.

01:15:55.590 --> 01:16:00.595
Now, can I just say, that Matthew,
he's quite something, isn't he?

01:16:00.729 --> 01:16:02.697
He's not
your average American.

01:16:02.831 --> 01:16:06.134
He's a Mr. International.
Even speaks a bit of Cantonese.

01:16:06.268 --> 01:16:11.641
Come here. You play Dry Eye
and I shall be Matthew.

01:16:13.241 --> 01:16:14.442
Come on.

01:16:19.114 --> 01:16:21.883
All right. [sighs]

01:16:23.118 --> 01:16:24.786
Try and get it in time
with his lips, all right?

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:26.521
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ready?

01:16:27.622 --> 01:16:28.823
Roll camera. Action.

01:16:28.957 --> 01:16:30.825
[crowd cheering]

01:16:37.332 --> 01:16:39.501
[camera beeps, clicks]

01:16:39.635 --> 01:16:42.037
[muffled chattering]

01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:44.539
[Raymond] There was an incident.
Lord George...

01:16:44.674 --> 01:16:45.774
[Fletcher]
Fuck's sake, Raymond.

01:16:45.907 --> 01:16:47.442
It's a bit fucking wooden.

01:16:47.576 --> 01:16:49.444
Put something into it,
you know, a bit of welly.

01:16:49.978 --> 01:16:51.413
And action.

01:16:51.546 --> 01:16:52.914
There was an incident.

01:16:53.048 --> 01:16:54.716
Lord George
didn't come through it.

01:16:54.849 --> 01:16:56.418
Didn't come through it?

01:16:56.551 --> 01:16:58.920
The last thing you need to do
is attract any octopus.

01:16:59.054 --> 01:17:00.355
Octopus?

01:17:01.623 --> 01:17:04.392
What does that mean?
It's not a very good translation.

01:17:04.526 --> 01:17:06.094
No, there's nothing wrong
with the translation.

01:17:06.228 --> 01:17:07.896
Matthew's not that fluent.
And it's Cantonese.

01:17:08.029 --> 01:17:09.564
Just go with it
and fill in the blanks.

01:17:09.699 --> 01:17:11.032
And action.

01:17:11.667 --> 01:17:13.735
[Raymond] It's all on Michael.
He's to blame.

01:17:14.502 --> 01:17:15.904
[Fletcher]
That is not a smart move.

01:17:16.037 --> 01:17:18.006
Don't tell me
what a smart move is.

01:17:18.139 --> 01:17:19.274
[Fletcher]
I beg for your pardon.

01:17:19.407 --> 01:17:21.109
You heard me
perfectly well.

01:17:21.243 --> 01:17:23.778
There will be repercussions
for Michael's actions.

01:17:23.912 --> 01:17:25.547
You think you're
running things, do you?

01:17:26.047 --> 01:17:27.949
Don't stroke my mouse hair.

01:17:29.217 --> 01:17:32.320
- What does "mouse hair" mean?
- Yeah, I think what he means is don't jeopardize my deal,

01:17:32.454 --> 01:17:34.289
but I admit that one's
a bit of a googly.

01:17:34.422 --> 01:17:36.091
Then Matthew loses it a bit

01:17:36.224 --> 01:17:38.560
and his translation goes
completely out of the window.

01:17:38.694 --> 01:17:41.496
Something about springtime
and sweaters.

01:17:41.631 --> 01:17:43.131
I think what he means
is he's upset.

01:17:43.265 --> 01:17:44.634
And then Dry Eye
says something,

01:17:44.766 --> 01:17:46.268
but some cunt
moved in front of me,

01:17:46.401 --> 01:17:47.737
so I didn't get that
either.

01:17:47.869 --> 01:17:49.938
Your Cantonese
is dog shit,

01:17:50.071 --> 01:17:51.139
so I'm gonna say this
in English

01:17:51.273 --> 01:17:52.307
and I'm gonna say it once,

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.142
so listen to me,
Rubenstein.

01:17:56.712 --> 01:17:58.446
This is how
it's gonna play out.

01:17:59.814 --> 01:18:01.483
You're gonna
back the fuck off...

01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:04.152
and I'm gonna
take it all.

01:18:05.453 --> 01:18:08.189
And you will pay me
my respect.

01:18:09.291 --> 01:18:11.526
[Fletcher] And there you have it.
That's all I've got.

01:18:11.661 --> 01:18:14.496
Sorry. Show's over.

01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:17.299
But I think
it's quite clear

01:18:17.432 --> 01:18:19.868
that they're not just
mah-jongg partners, are they?

01:18:20.435 --> 01:18:21.503
Mm?

01:18:29.077 --> 01:18:31.513
Not all of that
was clear, Fletcher.

01:18:31.647 --> 01:18:33.281
I mean,
according to you,

01:18:33.415 --> 01:18:35.751
we already know Matthew
wants to buy Michael out.

01:18:36.786 --> 01:18:40.255
- So why is that news?
- Oh, don't you worry, my darling.

01:18:40.388 --> 01:18:42.190
We are gonna
come to the news.

01:18:42.891 --> 01:18:45.593
I'm approaching my climax.

01:18:54.135 --> 01:18:57.439
I trust you will make
Michael Pearson pay for this.

01:18:58.306 --> 01:19:00.275
You are
the dragon head now.

01:19:00.408 --> 01:19:02.177
Solidify your position.

01:19:03.646 --> 01:19:04.979
It will be done, Uncle.

01:19:06.081 --> 01:19:08.950
[Fletcher] So Dry Eye got the upgrade
he was after, didn't he, Raymond?

01:19:09.084 --> 01:19:11.519
The question is,
what was he gonna do with it

01:19:11.654 --> 01:19:13.656
now that he's
Billy Big Bollocks?

01:19:13.789 --> 01:19:15.390
Give me ten minutes,
Ray.

01:19:16.524 --> 01:19:17.559
Boss.

["Cumberland Gap"
by David Rawlings plays]

01:19:31.473 --> 01:19:32.808
Hello, Ros.

01:19:32.941 --> 01:19:34.943
It's date night tonight,

9:00 p.m., you and I,

01:19:37.979 --> 01:19:40.248

01:19:48.724 --> 01:19:49.759
No.

Hang the fucking phone up.

01:19:51.559 --> 01:19:52.594
Who's there?

Ros, who's there?

01:19:56.431 --> 01:19:57.599
What you doing here,
Dry Eye?

01:20:00.268 --> 01:20:01.469
[chuckles]

01:20:01.603 --> 01:20:03.438
It's warming up now,
isn't it?

01:20:03.571 --> 01:20:07.275
At this point, I'm guessing
that you didn't even know

01:20:07.409 --> 01:20:09.444
that Lord George
was dead yet,

01:20:09.577 --> 01:20:11.946
let alone
what Dry Eye was up to.

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.549
Hello, Dry Eye.
What do you want?

01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:16.384
[phone beeps]

01:20:17.986 --> 01:20:19.387
[sighs]

01:20:26.961 --> 01:20:28.062
Fancy a boiled sweet?

01:20:28.731 --> 01:20:31.266
- No.
- Suit yourself.

01:20:39.574 --> 01:20:40.910
Who the fuck was he?

01:20:41.409 --> 01:20:43.211
[Fletcher] I'm not exactly
sure what happened next,

01:20:43.344 --> 01:20:45.781
because you two managed
to give me the slip.

01:20:45.915 --> 01:20:47.949
They got Rosalind.
Call Roger.

01:20:49.617 --> 01:20:51.821
Oh, goody. Another bottle.
[chuckles]

01:20:51.953 --> 01:20:54.088
Hold on. You were there?

01:20:54.222 --> 01:20:56.324
[camera shutter clicking]

01:20:56.792 --> 01:20:58.828
Yeah.
Of course I was there.

01:20:59.561 --> 01:21:02.932
He's not picking up. Maybe you
should put your seat belt on.

01:21:04.098 --> 01:21:06.100
Yeah, let me call Rosalind.
Let me do it.

01:21:06.401 --> 01:21:07.469
[car horn honks]

01:21:07.602 --> 01:21:09.772
I got it.
Just watch the road.

01:21:10.605 --> 01:21:12.440
- [phone ringing]
- Now, Rosalind, don't be alarmed,

01:21:12.574 --> 01:21:14.275
but you're gonna
come with me

01:21:14.409 --> 01:21:16.645
until I can resolve all these
issues with your husband.

01:21:17.412 --> 01:21:18.814
I'm not going anywhere.

01:21:19.614 --> 01:21:21.483
She's not picking up.
It's just ringing.

01:21:21.616 --> 01:21:24.419
- Fuck.
- We could just slow down a little bit.

01:21:26.254 --> 01:21:27.622
Fuck!

01:21:35.631 --> 01:21:36.665
[gasps]

01:21:42.337 --> 01:21:43.973
[Dry Eye]
You know how it works.

01:21:44.673 --> 01:21:48.176
You either come with me or Tony
here is gonna make you come with me.

01:21:48.309 --> 01:21:51.012
You're in my office
under my roof.

01:21:51.145 --> 01:21:52.915
It's not your position
for Tony to do anything

01:21:53.047 --> 01:21:55.383
other than to fuck off back
from whence he came.

01:21:55.517 --> 01:21:57.151
- [Tony chuckles]
- Tony.

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.724
What's that?
Is that a paperweight?

01:22:01.857 --> 01:22:05.360
Funny you should say that. Turns out
anything with weight can be a paperweight.

01:22:05.493 --> 01:22:07.663
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Well, that's up to you, isn't it?

01:22:07.796 --> 01:22:10.164
Either you do as I tell
you to and use the door,

01:22:10.298 --> 01:22:12.701
or I'm gonna shoot fat Tony
right between the eyes.

01:22:12.835 --> 01:22:14.837
You see, this gun's
only got two bullets,

01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:17.405
so I'm not gonna fuck about
illustrating its significance.

01:22:17.539 --> 01:22:19.274
You're gonna have to
trust me on that.

01:22:19.407 --> 01:22:21.209
The alternative
is a little bit absolute.

01:22:22.477 --> 01:22:24.379
I'm gonna have
to check your grammar on that.

01:22:24.847 --> 01:22:27.016
It can't be
just a little bit absolute.

01:22:27.148 --> 01:22:29.617
It either is or it isn't.

01:22:29.752 --> 01:22:32.855
Whatever it is,
I've lost my patience.

01:22:32.988 --> 01:22:36.859
I'm telling you, I will squeeze this
trigger and Tony will be no more.

01:22:36.992 --> 01:22:38.861
- Tony.
- [Tony exhales]

01:22:40.228 --> 01:22:42.765
Listen to me, cunt.
You take one step forward,

01:22:42.898 --> 01:22:44.733
it'll be the last fucking
step you ever take.

01:22:44.867 --> 01:22:46.234
Tony, get on it.

01:22:47.135 --> 01:22:48.169
[gasps]

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:06.354
[grunts]

01:23:12.427 --> 01:23:13.929
[panting]

01:23:21.569 --> 01:23:22.972
I fucking dare you.

01:23:25.674 --> 01:23:26.775
Just calm down.

01:23:27.876 --> 01:23:28.911
I'm leaving.

01:23:36.584 --> 01:23:38.053
I guess that's
your two bullets, eh?

01:23:39.021 --> 01:23:40.321
Rosalind!

01:23:40.622 --> 01:23:41.623
[Dry Eye shouts]

01:23:41.757 --> 01:23:44.125
[both grunting]

01:23:54.268 --> 01:23:55.638
Rosalind!

01:23:57.171 --> 01:23:58.874
[Dry Eye grunts]

01:24:02.143 --> 01:24:03.846
Stay fucking still!

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.054
Hello, babe.

01:24:12.186 --> 01:24:13.354
[gasps]

01:24:14.589 --> 01:24:16.624
[panting]

01:24:17.592 --> 01:24:19.293
[shuddered breathing]

01:24:24.867 --> 01:24:26.334
[body thuds]

01:24:28.937 --> 01:24:30.005
Hello, love.

01:24:30.673 --> 01:24:32.908
[Raymond] So you're
basing your whole crescendo

01:24:33.441 --> 01:24:35.077
on a figment
of your imagination.

01:24:35.209 --> 01:24:38.981
I'm basing my whole crescendo
on the sum of its parts.

01:24:39.114 --> 01:24:41.349
A few minor details aside,
I wouldn't have any trouble at all

01:24:41.482 --> 01:24:45.453
selling this juicy peach
of a drama to Big Dave.

01:24:45.586 --> 01:24:47.488
He'd cream
his fucking panties.

01:24:47.622 --> 01:24:50.291
You're too smart to be
blackmailing us, Fletcher.

01:24:50.425 --> 01:24:53.128
Yes, yes, and obviously I've
taken precautionary measures.

01:24:53.428 --> 01:24:56.832
[chuckles] You can do all kinds of
horrible things to me if you want.

01:24:57.331 --> 01:24:59.134
I might even enjoy them.

01:24:59.267 --> 01:25:01.870
But you'd have to leave the
country and never come back.

01:25:02.004 --> 01:25:03.972
So is that the story over
now, Fletcher?

01:25:04.106 --> 01:25:07.810
All this, this whole buildup,
was leading to this next part.

01:25:07.943 --> 01:25:11.180
This is the news that
you were asking about before.

01:25:11.312 --> 01:25:12.748
Ready?

01:25:13.347 --> 01:25:14.382
Matthew.

01:25:15.216 --> 01:25:17.019
He's gonna need some people
to run his business here

01:25:17.152 --> 01:25:19.054
when he buys it
from Michael, right?

01:25:19.188 --> 01:25:21.990
He's gonna need a reliable pair of
hands, someone like you.

01:25:22.124 --> 01:25:24.093
Hmm. So why didn't he
ask you, Raymond?

01:25:24.225 --> 01:25:26.594
I don't know.
It's none of my business.

01:25:26.729 --> 01:25:28.262
Because, I'll tell you,

01:25:28.897 --> 01:25:31.399
he already had someone
earmarked for the role.

01:25:32.201 --> 01:25:35.336
Dry Eye.
He promised Dry Eye the job,

01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:39.240
but only if Dry Eye helped drive
down the price of Mickey's business.

01:25:39.373 --> 01:25:43.746
You see, it was Matthew who told Dry
Eye the location of Mickey's farm,

01:25:43.879 --> 01:25:46.247
so he could steal
his white widow super cheese

01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:48.650
to cause ripples
and reduce the market value.

01:25:48.784 --> 01:25:51.452
And that is why Phuc,
in turn,

01:25:51.586 --> 01:25:55.824
got those juice-swilling,
acne-backed muscle Marys to do the job.

01:25:55.958 --> 01:25:57.826
It was Matthew

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.729
who set this whole
train of events off.

01:26:01.529 --> 01:26:03.799
But what he did not
plan on, you see...

01:26:03.932 --> 01:26:05.634
Fuck you,
you old cunt!

01:26:05.768 --> 01:26:07.069
I'll piss on your grave.

01:26:09.738 --> 01:26:11.339
...was Dry Eye...

01:26:13.242 --> 01:26:14.475
killing Lord George.

01:26:15.944 --> 01:26:19.580
Now, Dry Eye does not want to be
subservient to Matthew anymore.

01:26:19.715 --> 01:26:21.116
Doesn't wanna be
subservient to anyone.

01:26:21.250 --> 01:26:23.018
This is how
it's gonna play out.

01:26:23.152 --> 01:26:24.418
[crowd cheering,
applauding]

01:26:24.552 --> 01:26:26.354
You're gonna
back the fuck off

01:26:26.889 --> 01:26:28.857
and I'm gonna
take it all.

01:26:28.991 --> 01:26:32.694
Dry Eye likes the smell of
power and does not like Matthew.

01:26:32.828 --> 01:26:37.199
So, the little dragon needed a gentle
reminder of who was really running things.

01:26:37.331 --> 01:26:39.367
You've been in this paddling
pool for two minutes.

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:42.336
I've been swimming in the ocean
with the sharks for 20 years.

01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:45.040
I'll tell you
how this plays out.

01:26:45.774 --> 01:26:47.276
You will drown...

01:26:48.409 --> 01:26:51.146
and then my Mossad crabs
will eat you.

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:56.151
And this, my love, is why I want
my hard-earned 20 million pounds.

01:26:56.285 --> 01:27:02.323
Because not only do I know exactly
how Mickey's business operates,

01:27:02.456 --> 01:27:06.762
but I also know that the very
man he's trying to sell it to

01:27:06.895 --> 01:27:09.530
is trying to force him
into selling it on the cheap

01:27:09.665 --> 01:27:12.600
and has indirectly
started a war.

01:27:13.302 --> 01:27:16.638
So, you see, I think you should be
calling me your trusted consigliere,

01:27:17.605 --> 01:27:19.141
or your spy
behind the lines,

01:27:19.274 --> 01:27:23.278
your intellectual
reconnaissance, if you prefer.

01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:26.181
I'm impressed.

01:27:27.415 --> 01:27:29.617
You certainly know
more than I do.

01:27:29.751 --> 01:27:32.486
I'm impressed not only
by your information,

01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:34.723
but by your imagination.

01:27:35.489 --> 01:27:36.725
Thank you very much.

01:27:39.328 --> 01:27:41.129
So you've got 72 hours.

01:27:42.164 --> 01:27:45.366
And I would just reiterate
that if anything happens to me,

01:27:45.499 --> 01:27:47.836
I do have my insurance policy
in place.

01:27:48.303 --> 01:27:51.073
Everything will go to Big Dave,
and from him to the public,

01:27:51.206 --> 01:27:53.175
and you, my love,
will go to Mars.

01:27:53.308 --> 01:27:56.377
So, strong recommendation,
just pay up

01:27:56.510 --> 01:28:02.050
and watch me recede into the
sunset blowing kisses, yes?

01:28:05.087 --> 01:28:09.258
Well, then, time to use the
door, you black bastard.

01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:11.727
Well, that's just silly, isn't
it, 'cause I'm not black.

01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:14.730
No, but your fucking soul is,
you dark cunt.

01:28:16.932 --> 01:28:20.035
Now, out of my house,
'cause I'm going to bed.

01:28:22.536 --> 01:28:24.039
Can I come with you?

01:28:25.406 --> 01:28:29.443
No, but you can go smoke the exhaust
pipe in the back of your hearse.

01:28:31.113 --> 01:28:32.546
I might come anyway.

01:28:34.116 --> 01:28:36.752
You'll just hear me
scratching about in the dark,

01:28:37.451 --> 01:28:39.221
wanking into a hanky.

01:28:44.425 --> 01:28:46.962
All right, so, 20 million.

01:28:48.096 --> 01:28:49.998
You've got 72 hours,
starting now.

01:28:50.933 --> 01:28:53.601
Ticktock, ticktock.

01:28:55.137 --> 01:28:56.371
And I'm gone.

01:28:59.408 --> 01:29:00.943
Ticktock.

01:29:04.947 --> 01:29:06.648
Ticktock.

01:29:06.782 --> 01:29:10.218
[door opens, closes]

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:14.957
[phone dialing, ringing]

01:29:15.290 --> 01:29:16.258
[line clicks]

01:29:16.391 --> 01:29:18.060
[Raymond] He's just left.

01:29:18.193 --> 01:29:19.795
He thinks he's very clever.

01:29:20.561 --> 01:29:21.997
Start with Big Dave.

01:29:27.202 --> 01:29:29.304
Now, you keep this
between you and me, Hammy,

01:29:29.438 --> 01:29:32.007
but Fletcher's been in touch.
He says he's got what we need.

01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:34.608
Careful, boss. Fletcher's ass
belongs to the highest bidder.

01:29:34.743 --> 01:29:36.610
Yeah.
He says he wants 150 grand.

01:29:36.745 --> 01:29:39.114
But if it's proper, it's worth
a whole week's exclusive.

01:29:39.247 --> 01:29:40.514
Well, what does he
have exactly?

01:29:40.649 --> 01:29:42.084
He was just
tickling me nuts,

01:29:42.217 --> 01:29:43.517
but he says
he wants to meet Saturday.

01:29:43.652 --> 01:29:44.753
So keep it free.

01:29:44.886 --> 01:29:47.022
[phone: musical ringtone]

01:29:47.155 --> 01:29:48.522
Yeah, pronto.

01:29:55.563 --> 01:29:58.200
Oi, you can't park there,
mate. Move the van.

01:29:58.333 --> 01:30:00.469
Don't worry, friend.
We'll be gone in a minute.

01:30:00.601 --> 01:30:02.804
We're not a newspaper.
We're a blood sport.

01:30:02.938 --> 01:30:04.572
Oi, Russ. Move the van.

01:30:04.706 --> 01:30:06.241
I'm on it, boss.

01:30:07.042 --> 01:30:08.677
Move it. Now.

01:30:09.478 --> 01:30:12.580
- I said in a minute.
- Oi, spunk bubble.

01:30:12.714 --> 01:30:14.649
Get rid of
the fucking van.

01:30:14.783 --> 01:30:15.817
[van door closes]

01:30:19.888 --> 01:30:23.225
I'm warning you,
Russ does karate.

01:30:27.829 --> 01:30:31.099
Careful, boys.
Russ does karate.

01:30:32.533 --> 01:30:34.936
Russ, if you know
what's good for you,

01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:37.039
get in the car now.

01:30:38.073 --> 01:30:39.107
[exhales]

01:30:40.509 --> 01:30:43.577
Sorry, boss.
I'm only a blue belt.

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:46.515
You melt.

01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:51.386
Now what? We're making
a YouTube movie? Eh?

01:30:52.087 --> 01:30:53.355
Break dancing?

01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:57.426
I'm warning you.
I'm fucking powerful.

01:30:57.558 --> 01:31:00.695
We know all that. Why don't you tell
us all about it in the back of the van?

01:31:00.829 --> 01:31:03.865
[muttering] I'm not going.
I'm not fucking... No!

01:31:03.999 --> 01:31:05.867
[muttering] No.

01:31:06.001 --> 01:31:07.669
[Ernie] Get him in there.

01:31:10.472 --> 01:31:11.740
Unbelievable.

01:31:16.678 --> 01:31:18.113
Well, well, well.

01:31:19.848 --> 01:31:21.550
- [sighs]
- [grunts]

01:31:21.683 --> 01:31:23.752
You're all right, Big Dave.
You're in safe hands now.

01:31:23.885 --> 01:31:26.620
- No need to panic, okay?
- Who are you?

01:31:26.755 --> 01:31:28.589
Don't worry about that
right now.

01:31:29.758 --> 01:31:31.259
Look... [panting]

01:31:31.393 --> 01:31:33.028
Look, whatever's
gone on here,

01:31:33.161 --> 01:31:34.729
I just need
to get back to work.

01:31:34.863 --> 01:31:36.765
If you let me go,
I'll just forget all about it.

01:31:36.898 --> 01:31:39.868
I'll have you back to work
in short order, my friend.

01:31:40.001 --> 01:31:41.303
Now, I believe
you're a reporter.

01:31:42.737 --> 01:31:44.605
And there's something
I wanna report to you.

01:31:44.739 --> 01:31:46.775
Now, it seems for
this brief moment in time

01:31:46.908 --> 01:31:49.111
I've found my way
into the film business,

01:31:49.244 --> 01:31:53.949
and last night I made a film with
an impressively sized farmyard pig.

01:31:57.953 --> 01:32:00.422
Morning, sir.
Two cups of tea.

01:32:00.555 --> 01:32:03.091
One with sugar, one without.

01:32:03.225 --> 01:32:05.193
All right, lads,
go on, give us a minute.

01:32:06.061 --> 01:32:07.629
[snorting]

01:32:08.063 --> 01:32:09.998
[Coach] There are some wet
wipes there over your shoulder.

01:32:10.132 --> 01:32:12.534
Your clothes are neatly folded
there on the bench.

01:32:12.667 --> 01:32:16.304
Now, in due course, you're gonna
press the space bar on this computer

01:32:16.438 --> 01:32:19.941
and you're gonna witness your
participation in said film.

01:32:20.075 --> 01:32:23.478
Now, that little drug we
gave you last night really...

01:32:25.147 --> 01:32:26.882
loosened up
your inhibitions, man.

01:32:27.616 --> 01:32:31.119
The only thing you'll need to do to
stop this little creative expression

01:32:31.253 --> 01:32:33.722
from becoming
a social media sensation

01:32:33.855 --> 01:32:36.691
is lose any interest you have
in the future of Mickey Pearson.

01:32:38.093 --> 01:32:39.995
I'm gonna leave you now
to clean yourself up.

01:32:41.930 --> 01:32:43.532
Space bar, yeah?
Have a hot drink as well.

01:32:43.665 --> 01:32:45.700
It might make you feel
a little bit better.

01:32:45.834 --> 01:32:47.569
It was a fucking rough night
for you.

01:32:49.371 --> 01:32:50.972
- [door opens]
- Enjoy the show.

01:32:51.773 --> 01:32:52.807
[door closes]

01:32:57.445 --> 01:33:01.583
[children singing on video] ♪ Old
MacDonald Had a farm, e-i-e-i-o ♪

01:33:01.716 --> 01:33:04.386
- ♪ And on that farm He had a pig... ♪
- [pig snorting in video]

01:33:04.519 --> 01:33:06.755
- How's your man, then, Coach?
- Ah, he'll survive.

01:33:06.888 --> 01:33:08.890
- Wouldn't have been the pig I would have chosen, though.
- [chuckles]

[Big Dave screaming]

01:33:13.461 --> 01:33:14.963
We know what bit that is.

["Old MacDonald"

01:33:16.698 --> 01:33:18.733
[Big Dave on video]
Let me tickle that belly.

01:33:18.867 --> 01:33:21.637
- You are so naughty.
- [pig squealing on video]

01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:24.139
- Good Lord.
- I was there and I'm still shocked.

01:33:24.706 --> 01:33:26.408
[Big Dave]
Squeal for me, piggy.

01:33:26.541 --> 01:33:29.211
- Is that who I think it is?
- Yeah, it certainly is.

01:33:29.344 --> 01:33:31.012
[pig continues snorting]

01:33:31.813 --> 01:33:33.081
And that's your doing?

01:33:33.215 --> 01:33:35.016
[Big Dave]
Where is that applesauce?

01:33:35.617 --> 01:33:37.485
You can't unsee it
once you've seen it, can you?

01:33:37.619 --> 01:33:39.588
No, you can't unsee it.
It's nightmare fuel.

01:33:39.721 --> 01:33:40.889
That will be with me forever.

01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:43.725
That story
won't be running.

01:33:46.161 --> 01:33:48.930
Right. I've got one more
thing I need you to do.

01:33:49.064 --> 01:33:51.766
Ah, look,
before you continue, Ray,

01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:56.004
I train lads to be good lads.
I'm not a fucking gangster.

01:33:56.137 --> 01:33:59.507
Now, I've been forced to do some
gangster things, that's okay.

01:33:59.642 --> 01:34:01.677
But I'm not the gift
that keeps on giving.

01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:04.412
So with the greatest respect,
I'll do this one last thing for you

01:34:04.546 --> 01:34:06.014
and then that's it.

01:34:06.147 --> 01:34:09.551
No más.
Three strikes and I'm out.

01:34:14.256 --> 01:34:15.457
[sighs]

01:34:16.358 --> 01:34:18.426
- Everything all right, Coach?
- No, Ernie, it isn't.

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:21.129
You need to understand the
severity of your actions.

01:34:28.236 --> 01:34:29.838
Dave, an hour.

01:34:29.971 --> 01:34:31.006
Okay, boss.

01:34:36.044 --> 01:34:38.146
Thank you
for the grand tour.

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.814
I'm a believer.

01:34:39.948 --> 01:34:41.283
[Mickey] Thank you, chaps.

01:34:43.618 --> 01:34:46.021
[Matthew] Now, are we ready
to finalize the numbers?

01:34:46.821 --> 01:34:47.922
We already have.

01:34:48.056 --> 01:34:49.491
Mm...

01:34:49.624 --> 01:34:51.761
The situation's changed,
Michael.

01:34:51.893 --> 01:34:54.462
- The market's changed.
- How so?

01:34:54.996 --> 01:34:58.600
The exit value of your business
needs to be recalculated.

01:34:59.334 --> 01:35:01.269
Please, be specific.

01:35:01.403 --> 01:35:03.305
Oh, I will be.

01:35:03.438 --> 01:35:06.776
You're asking 400 for 12 locations
and a distribution network,

01:35:06.908 --> 01:35:09.377
which was a fair valuation
at the time.

01:35:09.511 --> 01:35:12.314
But when one of those
locations was compromised,

01:35:12.447 --> 01:35:14.784
the value of all those
locations were compromised

01:35:14.916 --> 01:35:16.618
and this obviously
affects the price.

01:35:17.452 --> 01:35:21.089
Your skunk farm was a fucking viral
sensation on YouTube, Michael.

01:35:21.222 --> 01:35:23.693
And when Johnny Law starts
sniffing, which he will,

01:35:23.825 --> 01:35:25.927
all of those locations
will have to cease production

01:35:26.061 --> 01:35:29.831
for, I'd say, at least 12 months
at a cost of 100 million net p.a.,

01:35:29.964 --> 01:35:32.668
before marking down the loss of
staff, relocation and site rentals.

01:35:32.802 --> 01:35:34.602
- You still with me?
- Yes, I'm following.

01:35:34.737 --> 01:35:36.871
It will take
at least three years

01:35:37.005 --> 01:35:40.475
to get your supply, distribution
and demand back to full capacity.

01:35:40.608 --> 01:35:44.346
Your staffing costs are 25% of
your 100 million operational cost,

01:35:44.479 --> 01:35:48.049
so that's 25 million per annum
for three annums.

01:35:48.183 --> 01:35:50.518
And location rental
at 15 million a year,

01:35:50.653 --> 01:35:54.690
that's a 120 GBP bite
right there.

01:35:54.824 --> 01:35:57.392
Your unit economics
have taken a hit,

01:35:57.525 --> 01:36:02.063
and forecasting out your top-line growth
margin in the current inimical climate,

01:36:02.197 --> 01:36:05.467
I calculate what was worth
400 million a month ago

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:10.071
must now be valued
at an anemic, mm... 130.

01:36:11.306 --> 01:36:15.043
You see, it's not about the
first domino that fell, Michael.

01:36:15.877 --> 01:36:17.045
It's about the last.

01:36:19.381 --> 01:36:20.448
Please.

01:36:23.985 --> 01:36:26.722
I like you, Michael.
You're a good chap.

01:36:27.522 --> 01:36:31.226
And if you want me to help you out of
this hole you've found yourself in,

01:36:31.861 --> 01:36:34.896
I can pay you
100 million dollars today.

01:36:35.897 --> 01:36:38.366
It's a good offer
and it's real,

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.636
and I'll do this
because I'm your friend.

01:36:40.770 --> 01:36:43.873
My accountant can transfer
the fee within the hour.

01:36:44.774 --> 01:36:46.809
I like your domino analogy.

01:36:48.543 --> 01:36:52.580
The question I ask is,
who tumbled the first domino?

01:36:53.214 --> 01:36:56.317
I'm afraid that's not my
concern or my business, Michael.

01:36:56.451 --> 01:36:58.286
At the risk
of contradicting you,

01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:02.390
it is very much your business,
and certainly your concern.

01:37:03.859 --> 01:37:05.326
Only you made one mistake.

01:37:06.695 --> 01:37:07.830
That being?

01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:11.399
You seem to have mistaken me
for some kind of a cunt.

01:37:13.234 --> 01:37:15.638
Let me introduce you
to the first domino.

01:37:19.708 --> 01:37:24.379
It's a tad dramatic, isn't it,
corpses in freezers? Who is this man?

01:37:24.512 --> 01:37:26.548
What's he got to do with
anything that I'm talking about?

01:37:26.682 --> 01:37:29.284
I take it with that statement
you are in denial

01:37:29.417 --> 01:37:31.986
of so-said relationship
with this frozen Chinaman?

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:34.289
Well, of course
I'm in denial of it.

01:37:34.422 --> 01:37:38.092
I don't have relationships
with dead, frozen Chinamen.

01:37:38.226 --> 01:37:41.797
Best not to be glib at this time
in the proceedings, Matthew.

01:37:45.533 --> 01:37:47.770
Don't bother looking
for your Mossad crabs.

01:37:47.903 --> 01:37:50.338
This is a fish market.
They have found a home.

01:37:50.873 --> 01:37:53.408
To be clear,
I do not know that man.

01:37:55.711 --> 01:37:57.512
I'll tell you
how this plays out.

01:37:58.112 --> 01:38:02.685
You will drown and then
my Mossad crabs will eat you.

01:38:02.818 --> 01:38:06.120
So while you were discussing
who would take over my business

01:38:06.254 --> 01:38:07.756
after you fucked it,

01:38:08.724 --> 01:38:11.794
you somehow mistook so-said
Chinaman for someone else?

01:38:13.461 --> 01:38:17.499
Business is business, Michael.
It's nothing personal.

01:38:17.633 --> 01:38:19.969
While I am not emotional
about the money,

01:38:20.101 --> 01:38:23.873
there is a price indebted to me for
the blood I've gotten on my hands

01:38:24.005 --> 01:38:27.408
restoring order to the
untidiness that you created,

01:38:27.542 --> 01:38:29.177
and that price,
according to you...

01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:33.348
400 minus 130...
is 270 million dollars.

01:38:33.481 --> 01:38:36.551
And I'm keeping
the business,

01:38:37.853 --> 01:38:40.990
while you are
getting in the freezer.

01:38:41.657 --> 01:38:44.760
And you will make that transaction if
you want to get out of the freezer.

01:38:44.894 --> 01:38:49.364
It is 25 below zero in there,
so I assume you'll last about an hour.

01:38:49.497 --> 01:38:51.266
That said,
I wouldn't fuck about,

01:38:51.399 --> 01:38:53.568
because frostbite is very
expensive on the fingers and toes,

01:38:53.702 --> 01:38:57.539
so I would type as quickly as possible
while you have the use of them.

01:38:58.239 --> 01:39:00.341
- Uh...
- After you've attended to that indiscretion,

01:39:00.475 --> 01:39:04.345
you can then deal with the next
consequence of your shortsightedness.

01:39:04.914 --> 01:39:08.884
As stated,
I am not emotional about the money.

01:39:11.586 --> 01:39:15.256
But I am emotional about the fact that
someone laid their hands on my wife.

01:39:16.157 --> 01:39:18.459
[panting]

01:39:18.593 --> 01:39:19.862
My wife!

01:39:22.463 --> 01:39:25.901
No amount of money on God's green earth
can pay for that transgression, Matthew.

01:39:26.035 --> 01:39:27.602
No, for that...

01:39:31.472 --> 01:39:32.708
I want a pound of flesh.

01:39:33.876 --> 01:39:34.944
A pound of flesh?

01:39:35.076 --> 01:39:36.611
It matters not to me

01:39:36.745 --> 01:39:38.747
where on your anatomy
it is withdrawn from.

01:39:39.682 --> 01:39:42.885
If you don't have the stomach
to take it for yourself,

01:39:43.018 --> 01:39:45.119
big Bunny here
is very adept with a knife,

01:39:45.253 --> 01:39:47.088
and, as you can see,
he's dressed for the weather.

01:39:47.221 --> 01:39:51.526
But a penny short
or a gram shy...

01:39:52.928 --> 01:39:55.363
and that freezer door
does not open.

01:39:55.496 --> 01:39:56.531
Am I clear?

01:39:57.666 --> 01:39:58.701
Good.

01:39:59.768 --> 01:40:01.436
- Bunny.
- [Bunny] Incoming.

01:40:11.714 --> 01:40:14.083
- [sizzles]
- [Fletcher chuckles]

01:40:14.215 --> 01:40:16.618
What, is it Wagyu again
for breakfast, Raymond?

01:40:18.954 --> 01:40:22.624
Aren't you gonna introduce me to your
mysterious and slightly menacing friend?

01:40:27.997 --> 01:40:30.099
What's that for?
Is that for my money?

01:40:30.598 --> 01:40:32.101
[chuckles]

01:40:32.567 --> 01:40:33.702
Where's my money, Raymond?

01:40:33.836 --> 01:40:35.303
There's your payment.

01:40:39.108 --> 01:40:40.608
Go on, take a look.

01:40:40.743 --> 01:40:42.610
Thank you,
mysterious stranger.

01:40:52.755 --> 01:40:55.289
Well, that's disappointing, 'cause that
doesn't look like 20 million pounds.

01:40:55.423 --> 01:40:58.459
It's more interesting than that,
your insurance policy,

01:40:58.593 --> 01:41:01.997
all the photos, all the bodies,
all the skeletons, all the filth.

01:41:02.131 --> 01:41:06.367
It's not the only one,
darling. I'm not a mong.

01:41:06.501 --> 01:41:08.804
What do you think's in that,
you fucking eejit?

01:41:09.672 --> 01:41:11.807
[Raymond] Of course we were
aware of what Matthew was up to.

01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:13.676
We're not complete
fucking idiots.

01:41:13.809 --> 01:41:15.744
[sizzles]

01:41:15.878 --> 01:41:18.647
I've been onto you
for a long time, Fletcher.

01:41:19.614 --> 01:41:21.684
- I knew you'd been following Michael.
- [camera shutter clicks]

01:41:21.817 --> 01:41:23.451
They're very similar,
our jobs.

01:41:24.019 --> 01:41:26.254
Only I'm better at it
than you are.

01:41:27.956 --> 01:41:31.526
I knew when you came over that night that
you'd only be there for half an hour...

01:41:32.393 --> 01:41:34.328
Buenas tardes, Raymondo.

01:41:34.462 --> 01:41:37.532
...to tell me how clever you
are and try to blackmail us.

01:41:38.266 --> 01:41:40.535
I've got some very important
information to impart to you, Raymond.

01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:44.173
I also knew you couldn't
resist a £1500 single malt,

01:41:44.305 --> 01:41:47.710
an £80 Wagyu steak and a
state-of-the-art smokeless barbie

01:41:48.276 --> 01:41:50.913
- that even keeps your feet warm.
- I love a barbie.

01:41:51.046 --> 01:41:53.916
I promise you, you will regret
this if you don't hear it.

01:41:54.049 --> 01:41:56.685
And when the Scotch
got into your cold veins,

01:41:56.819 --> 01:41:59.520
you lost the benefit
of your sharp instincts.

01:41:59.988 --> 01:42:02.223
Oh, goody. Another bottle.
[chuckles]

01:42:02.356 --> 01:42:04.893
Can you tell the mysterious
gentleman to relax?

01:42:05.027 --> 01:42:08.063
Because I promise you, you will regret it
if you don't hear this. Sit down, my love.

01:42:08.197 --> 01:42:11.599
See, I kept you there 'cause I needed
to know about Matthew and Dry Eye.

01:42:12.801 --> 01:42:15.838
Took us a while to find
your insurance policies.

01:42:17.505 --> 01:42:19.540
'Cause you're
a naughty squirrel, Fletcher.

01:42:20.475 --> 01:42:22.610
Fletcher, shoes off inside.

01:42:22.745 --> 01:42:24.046
Yes, Mommy.

01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:28.416
But it was made a lot easier after
I planted a tracker in your shoe.

01:42:32.888 --> 01:42:35.090
You're never gonna be
a predator with us, Fletcher.

01:42:36.959 --> 01:42:38.794
You're always
gonna be prey.

01:42:40.028 --> 01:42:43.397
So that's it. Three strikes.
We're good, right?

01:42:46.101 --> 01:42:49.238
- I'll see you around.
- With the greatest respect, I hope not.

01:42:55.576 --> 01:42:59.982
[sighs] Now, Fletcher,
what were you saying?

01:43:00.716 --> 01:43:03.284
[Fletcher, muffled] It wasn't
Lord George that was after Mickey,

01:43:03.417 --> 01:43:05.854
or Dry Eye, or Matthew.

01:43:06.989 --> 01:43:08.322
Do you wanna know who it was?

01:43:12.961 --> 01:43:14.163
I've got photos.

01:43:16.899 --> 01:43:18.767
Right.
You've got 30 seconds.

01:43:18.901 --> 01:43:19.935
Thank you, darling.

01:43:21.970 --> 01:43:23.806
- [phone vibrating]

01:43:25.573 --> 01:43:27.009
Primetime,
what is it, son?

01:43:27.142 --> 01:43:29.945
Coach, we're gonna take
care of this for you.

01:43:30.078 --> 01:43:31.445
Ernie's got a plan.

01:43:31.713 --> 01:43:33.414
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:43:33.548 --> 01:43:36.785
The Michael situation.
We're gonna sort it.

[gate clinks]

01:43:53.735 --> 01:43:55.503
[Fletcher] Now, you
remember Aslan, don't you?

01:43:56.138 --> 01:43:58.640
The young gentleman
you kept in the freezer?

01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:05.647
Well, this is Aslan Senior,
Russian oligarch.

01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:09.350
Ex-KGB. Made all
his money in gas pipes.

01:44:09.483 --> 01:44:12.688
And he's extremely sad that his
one-and-only son fell out of a window.

01:44:13.155 --> 01:44:14.656
[boy] Oh, shit.

01:44:14.957 --> 01:44:16.859
And I fear that where
they failed before, Raymond,

01:44:16.992 --> 01:44:19.194
they're not gonna fail again.

01:44:19.328 --> 01:44:21.330
And how do you know
all this?

01:44:21.462 --> 01:44:24.666
Because someone told them everything
they want to know about Michael,

01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:27.468
and that someone is me.

01:44:28.670 --> 01:44:29.872
Go on.

01:44:30.839 --> 01:44:33.574
[Fletcher] So I said I'd tell them
where Michael was for a price.

01:44:34.475 --> 01:44:38.280
But that money was pending till
after, you know, the deed was done.

01:44:38.412 --> 01:44:39.447
[gunshot]

01:44:40.249 --> 01:44:42.050
And then when they
messed up the first time,

01:44:42.184 --> 01:44:45.519
I had a little rethink and came
up with my version 2.0 plan,

01:44:45.654 --> 01:44:47.555
which is
when I came to see you.

01:44:47.689 --> 01:44:50.391
You see, get my 20 mils
off Michael first

01:44:50.524 --> 01:44:54.930
and then, after the event,
get paid again, double bubble.

01:44:55.063 --> 01:44:58.466
But you and your mysterious friend
put paid to that, so well done, you.

01:44:59.268 --> 01:45:00.769
Why did you just
look at your watch?

01:45:02.237 --> 01:45:05.774
Well, it's like I say.
The Russians are gonna clean house.

01:45:05.908 --> 01:45:08.977
And you are part of
that house, Raymond.

01:45:09.111 --> 01:45:12.080
They're gonna get Michael when he comes
out of his meeting at the fish market.

01:45:13.115 --> 01:45:15.717
And they are coming here.
So you see what I've done there?

01:45:16.218 --> 01:45:18.053
By telling you,
I've saved your lives.

01:45:18.186 --> 01:45:20.155

saves mine, doesn't it?
