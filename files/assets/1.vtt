WEBVTT

00:01:42.716 --> 00:01:44.385
All the food's gonna go bad

00:01:47.053 --> 00:01:48.304
Yeah, I drew up a list

00:01:48.388 --> 00:01:51.641
I'll hit the store
before it gets all bought out

00:01:54.394 --> 00:01:55.395
Fuck

00:01:55.478 --> 00:01:57.939
- Can you save it?
- No. No way

00:01:58.022 --> 00:02:00.608
No, I gotta start over from scratch

00:02:00.692 --> 00:02:02.944
I'll call the studio
when the phones get back up,

00:02:03.027 --> 00:02:04.612
see if they can extend my deadline

00:02:05.864 --> 00:02:07.490
What choice do they have?

00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:11.160
You kiddin'?

00:02:11.244 --> 00:02:14.079
They could whip up some bad
Photoshop poster in an afternoon

00:02:14.162 --> 00:02:16.415
They do it all the time
Two big heads

00:02:16.498 --> 00:02:18.375
I should have brought it downstairs
with me last night

00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:20.127
Just stupid, I guess

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.170
Well, sweetie,
you couldn't exactly know

00:02:22.254 --> 00:02:24.214
that a tree was gonna come flying
through the window

00:02:24.256 --> 00:02:25.716
Yeah, I'll hit the hardware store too,

00:02:25.757 --> 00:02:27.342
get some plastic sheeting
and duct tape

00:02:27.384 --> 00:02:29.553
and seal this up
before it gets dark, you know

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:31.221
Order in some new glass

00:02:32.723 --> 00:02:34.057
Oh, you know what?
That was your...

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.685
that was your grandfather's tree,
the one he planted

00:02:36.727 --> 00:02:39.479
Used to play in that tree

00:02:39.563 --> 00:02:40.689
It's just stuff, though

00:02:40.772 --> 00:02:43.316
You know, we're safe
That's all that counts

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:44.525
Yeah

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.110
Mom, Dad, you gotta come see!

00:02:46.193 --> 00:02:47.904
Hey, Billy, take it easy,
all right?

00:02:47.987 --> 00:02:49.697
I really don’t want you running
all over the place

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.865
But you gotta come look

00:02:50.948 --> 00:02:53.951
The boathouse is all bashed!
Holy crap!

00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:55.203
Billy

00:02:55.244 --> 00:02:58.331
Sorry, Mom, but you just
gotta come! Come on!

00:03:01.334 --> 00:03:03.252
Come on

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:05.254
Having spoken,
the Doomsayer departs

00:03:05.338 --> 00:03:07.924
Come on!

00:03:08.007 --> 00:03:10.008
How do you two always manage
to make me laugh?

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:13.720
You have incredibly low standards

00:03:13.803 --> 00:03:16.848
Let's go, uh, see the damage

00:03:16.932 --> 00:03:17.891
No

00:03:22.854 --> 00:03:24.898
- Norton's tree
- Yeah

00:03:26.524 --> 00:03:28.443
You mean the dead one
I've been asking him

00:03:28.527 --> 00:03:30.695
to take down for three years
before it finally blew over?

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:31.738
That tree?

00:03:32.948 --> 00:03:35.992
- Really got smooshed
- You ain't kiddin'

00:03:37.368 --> 00:03:39.078
Look at that

00:03:41.372 --> 00:03:42.498
What is it, Daddy?

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:44.500
Mist

00:03:46.043 --> 00:03:48.963
- On the lake?
- We've had mist on the lake before

00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:50.965
Coming off the mountain like that?

00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:53.509
Two fronts meeting,

00:03:53.592 --> 00:03:55.803
left over from the storm,
something like that

00:03:55.886 --> 00:03:57.388
You sure?

00:03:57.471 --> 00:03:58.889
Honey, I'm not the weatherman

00:03:58.973 --> 00:04:01.100
Why don't you take Billy,
get him dressed

00:04:01.183 --> 00:04:02.518
I'll take him to town with me

00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:03.978
Okay Where you going?

00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:07.146
I'm gonna go have a little chat
with our neighbour about his tree

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.314
Hon

00:04:08.398 --> 00:04:10.400
Don’t worry, I'm not gonna
punch him in the nose

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:11.818
You know what he's gonna say

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.904
He's gonna say, "Sue me,"
which, I don't know, maybe we should

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.782
Honey, one property dispute
with this guy

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.284
is enough to last me a lifetime

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:21.995
I'm gonna ask
for his insurance information

00:04:22.078 --> 00:04:23.079
Okay

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:25.123
- That's all
- Yeah

00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:30.670
Ohh!
Mother fucker!

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:35.340
Aw, shit!

00:04:35.382 --> 00:04:37.843
Ohh, you mother fucker!

00:04:39.177 --> 00:04:40.178
Cock sucker!

00:04:42.347 --> 00:04:43.348
"Turn on

00:04:43.432 --> 00:04:45.642
"Full choke

00:04:45.684 --> 00:04:47.853
Pull five choke"

00:04:52.316 --> 00:04:53.817
I guess you’ve seen the...

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.361
boathouse

00:04:56.445 --> 00:04:57.779
Yeah, and...?

00:04:57.863 --> 00:04:59.488
Nothin'

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.867
Just think we should trade
insurance info, you know?

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:03.951
That's all

00:05:06.662 --> 00:05:09.165
Oh, my insurance guy's
gonna love me

00:05:12.001 --> 00:05:13.377
Oh

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.421
Shit The 1980

00:05:15.504 --> 00:05:17.381
I was gonna bring
the station wagon, but

00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:20.676
I don't know, the weather was
so beautiful coming out of New York,

00:05:20.718 --> 00:05:22.970
I just...
You know, top down

00:05:23.054 --> 00:05:24.764
I'm sorry, man I mean it

00:05:24.847 --> 00:05:26.349
Sincerely

00:05:28.016 --> 00:05:30.685
- That's nice of you to say
- No, that car was cherry

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:32.395
I hate to see it like that

00:05:35.357 --> 00:05:36.858
Okay, I'll tell you what,

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.694
I'll find my insurance guy's number,
I'll bring it by later

00:05:39.778 --> 00:05:41.363
- That okay?
- No problem

00:05:47.702 --> 00:05:48.662
So, uh, David...

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.875
you’re not heading into town today
by any chance, are you?

00:06:08.806 --> 00:06:10.474
Well, CMP's out in force

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:12.977
Maybe we'll get our power back

00:06:13.561 --> 00:06:15.062
I know Some storm, huh?

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:16.438
One for the books, yeah

00:06:16.522 --> 00:06:18.190
For a moment there last night,

00:06:18.274 --> 00:06:20.693
I thought we were gonna take off
and head for Oz

00:06:20.776 --> 00:06:22.819
WZON is off the air,

00:06:22.902 --> 00:06:25.113
but Portland's still broadcasting

00:06:25.196 --> 00:06:26.197
Daddy, look

00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:28.116
Ah

00:06:28.157 --> 00:06:30.034
guys from the base

00:06:30.118 --> 00:06:31.661
- From up the mountain?
- Uh-huh

00:06:31.744 --> 00:06:33.329
The Arrowhead Project?

00:06:35.164 --> 00:06:36.165
Well, you’re a local

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:38.001
Any idea what they do up there?

00:06:38.084 --> 00:06:39.586
Missile defence research

00:06:39.627 --> 00:06:41.462
You know, I'm sure
you’ve heard the stories

00:06:41.546 --> 00:06:42.547
Oh, sure

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.008
The woman at the Laundromat
say that, uh,

00:06:45.091 --> 00:06:48.177
they have a crashed flying saucer
up there with frozen alien bodies

00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:50.013
Right Miss Edna Yeah

00:06:50.095 --> 00:06:52.681
Miss Tabloid

00:06:52.764 --> 00:06:55.434
"I Had Bigfoot's Baby"

00:06:56.685 --> 00:06:59.271
"Satan's Face Appears
in Oil Well Fire"

00:06:59.313 --> 00:07:00.647
You know, real reliable stuff

00:07:05.402 --> 00:07:06.904
Well, they're in a hurry

00:07:06.987 --> 00:07:08.614
Maybe their power's out too

00:07:17.872 --> 00:07:18.873
Huh Still no signal

00:07:19.457 --> 00:07:22.126
Why don't you go ahead?
I'm gonna try Steph on a pay phone

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.920
Can I go with Mr Norton, Daddy?

00:07:24.003 --> 00:07:26.797
Sure, if you promise
to hold his hand, I guess

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:27.840
Yeah
- Yeah

00:07:27.924 --> 00:07:29.508
Here's a list

00:07:29.592 --> 00:07:30.927
- Sure
- Okay?

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.178
Meet you guys in there

00:07:34.263 --> 00:07:35.264
Hold hands

00:07:39.101 --> 00:07:41.354
I'm sorry I didn't know
it was your sister

00:07:45.857 --> 00:07:47.901
That looks so freaky!

00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:48.944
Hmm

00:07:56.868 --> 00:07:58.411
- Sally, hey
- Hey, Mr Drayton on

00:07:58.495 --> 00:08:00.038
You guys look jammed up

00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:03.250
Yeah, well, half the staff
didn't show, plus the power's out

00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:05.669
Oh, no What,
no backup generator?

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.212
Only to keep the food cold

00:08:07.295 --> 00:08:08.838
Everything else,
welcome to the Dark Ages,

00:08:08.922 --> 00:08:10.006
and bring your check book

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.592
Hey, Thursday night,
Steph and I want a date night

00:08:12.676 --> 00:08:15.094
- Baby-sit?
- Heck, yeah I'm there

00:08:16.637 --> 00:08:17.721
Oh, my God

00:08:17.805 --> 00:08:19.306
The storm

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.476
Every body's stockin' up
Been like this since we opened

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.686
Crappy day, huh?

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:26.272
Eh, every one's a little
pissed off this morning

00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:28.190
'Morning, Mrs Carmody

00:08:29.316 --> 00:08:31.902
With lines like these,
I don't know how good it is,

00:08:31.986 --> 00:08:34.196
but I guess we'll have to make do

00:08:35.155 --> 00:08:37.700
- Keep your head down, pal
- I know it

00:08:41.494 --> 00:08:42.495
Hey, champ

00:08:43.663 --> 00:08:44.998
Your wife should be a doctor

00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:47.208
She could make a fortune
in Manhattan with this handwriting

00:08:47.292 --> 00:08:50.086
Yeah, it takes some getting used to

00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:52.338
Why don't you get your stuff?
I'll meet you at the checkout

00:08:52.422 --> 00:08:53.381
Okay, done

00:08:56.175 --> 00:08:59.304
Hey, David,
thanks for helping me out today

00:09:03.099 --> 00:09:05.101
Are you and Mr Norton
gonna be friends now, Daddy?

00:09:05.185 --> 00:09:06.728
Oh, I don't know

00:09:08.104 --> 00:09:10.105
"Friends" might be
stretching it a little

00:09:11.106 --> 00:09:13.483
I guess you’re not mad
at each other any more

00:09:13.567 --> 00:09:14.568
I guess not

00:09:16.278 --> 00:09:17.946
And that's a start, huh?

00:09:18.989 --> 00:09:20.991
I'm sorry, ma'am,
the registers are down

00:09:21.074 --> 00:09:23.076
The power outage got us too

00:09:23.118 --> 00:09:25.787
Hopefully we'll have
power up pretty soon

00:09:35.631 --> 00:09:38.341
- The bus leaves in 30 minutes
- We'll make it, okay?

00:09:38.424 --> 00:09:40.426
You guys get the goodies
I'll wait in line

00:09:45.806 --> 00:09:47.767
I need some change
on register five

00:09:49.393 --> 00:09:51.437
Good morning, Ms Reppler

00:09:51.479 --> 00:09:52.772
Hello, Ms Reppler

00:09:52.813 --> 00:09:55.983
Well, hello to you, Billy Drayton on

00:09:56.067 --> 00:09:57.735
How'd you hold up in the storm?

00:09:57.818 --> 00:09:59.946
We had a tree come through
the picture window last night,

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:01.197
right in my studio

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.241
And the boathouse got all smooshed
Mr Norton's tree fell on it

00:10:04.324 --> 00:10:05.283
Ouch

00:10:05.367 --> 00:10:07.869
- Yeah
Sorry to hear that

00:10:10.789 --> 00:10:12.123
How'd you guys make out?

00:10:12.165 --> 00:10:15.335
Oh, we're fine
It's the listings I'm worried about

00:10:15.418 --> 00:10:18.255
At the very least, I'll bet every one
of our "For Sale" signs fell over

00:10:18.338 --> 00:10:20.966
We had damage
at the school, wouldn't you know?

00:10:21.049 --> 00:10:24.052
That's what we get for not fixing
that roof when we should've,

00:10:24.135 --> 00:10:27.639
but with funds being cut every year

00:10:27.722 --> 00:10:29.182
You'd think educating children

00:10:29.266 --> 00:10:31.475
would be more
of a priority in this country,

00:10:31.517 --> 00:10:33.644
but you’d be wrong

00:10:33.686 --> 00:10:36.814
Government's got better things
to spend our money on,

00:10:36.897 --> 00:10:40.568
like corporate handouts
and building bombs

00:10:54.164 --> 00:10:55.708
Daddy, is there a fire?
Is Mommy all right?

00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:58.586
I'm sure she's fine
Don’t worry, okay?

00:10:59.669 --> 00:11:01.170
Mind what you’re doing, Sally

00:11:02.088 --> 00:11:03.756
Oh, come on,
we got 10 days' leave

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.841
Check our papers

00:11:04.924 --> 00:11:06.926
Look, I told you,
all leaves are cancelled

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:07.969
I don't know why

00:11:08.052 --> 00:11:10.054
I gotta go check the pharmacy out

00:11:10.138 --> 00:11:12.599
Three men meet me
back at the Jeep in five minutes

00:11:12.682 --> 00:11:13.683
That's an order

00:11:16.186 --> 00:11:19.689
Shit, man! Another half an hour,
and we'd have been gone

00:11:52.888 --> 00:11:54.472
Oh, my God!

00:12:02.772 --> 00:12:04.148
Something in the mist!

00:12:04.232 --> 00:12:06.067
Something in the mist

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.652
took John Lee!

00:12:07.735 --> 00:12:09.070
Dan, catch your breath

00:12:09.111 --> 00:12:10.988
Something in the mist took John Lee

00:12:11.072 --> 00:12:12.823
I could hear him screaming

00:12:12.907 --> 00:12:15.826
Shut the doors! Shut the doors!
My God!

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.578
Daddy, I'm scared
Can we go home?

00:12:22.082 --> 00:12:23.041
Don't go out there

00:12:23.124 --> 00:12:25.377
There's something in the mist
It took John Lee

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.921
Screw that!
I'm gettin' in my car

00:12:28.004 --> 00:12:29.506
Mister, no!

00:13:01.787 --> 00:13:03.289
Please hold me

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.332
It's okay, it's okay

00:13:05.416 --> 00:13:09.545
It's a pollution cloud
The mills down in Rumford

00:13:09.628 --> 00:13:12.715
Some kind of chemical explosion
Has to be

00:13:14.091 --> 00:13:15.593
What is it?

00:13:16.844 --> 00:13:18.303
What's going on?

00:13:21.514 --> 00:13:22.640
It's death

00:13:57.466 --> 00:13:59.885
Stay down!

00:14:01.053 --> 00:14:02.221
Daddy!

00:14:09.978 --> 00:14:11.188
You okay?

00:14:21.405 --> 00:14:22.907
That was an earthquake

00:14:23.908 --> 00:14:26.202
I tell you, the goddamn mills blew up!

00:14:26.285 --> 00:14:29.747
Is every one okay?
Is any one hurt?

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:33.125
Every body just stay put, okay?
Just stay inside the store

00:14:33.209 --> 00:14:36.087
I can't I can't stay here
I gotta get home to my kids

00:14:36.128 --> 00:14:39.215
No
No, don't go out there

00:14:39.298 --> 00:14:42.092
It's death out there
It's the end of days

00:14:42.175 --> 00:14:44.219
Stop it, okay? Stop it

00:14:44.261 --> 00:14:47.097
Please, every body,
every body just relax, okay?

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.182
He's right Let's just stay cool

00:14:49.266 --> 00:14:50.642
Let's just try to figure out
what happened

00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:55.105
I'm sorry, I... I can’t just stay here
I have to get home to my kids

00:14:55.146 --> 00:14:57.065
Ma'am, no, you can't go out there

00:14:57.107 --> 00:14:58.817
Could be a poisonous gas cloud

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.402
Didn't you hear that man screaming?

00:15:00.443 --> 00:15:03.113
I agree Let's stay here
until we figure it out

00:15:03.196 --> 00:15:04.573
You're not listening!

00:15:05.115 --> 00:15:06.825
I can't stay here

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.787
Wanda's looking after little Victor
She's only 8

00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:15.749
Sometimes she forgets
she's supposed to be watching him

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.089
I told them I'd only be gone
a few minutes

00:15:23.299 --> 00:15:25.593
She's only 8

00:15:26.635 --> 00:15:28.095
For their sakes,

00:15:28.137 --> 00:15:29.471
don't

00:15:34.643 --> 00:15:37.187
Well, isn't anybody gonna help me?

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:41.649
Shh It's okay, pal

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:45.361
Won't somebody here
see a lady home?

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:51.534
You?

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:00.210
You?

00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:11.970
It's okay, buddy
- You?

00:16:12.012 --> 00:16:15.307
Ma'am, please,
I got my own boy to worry about

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.980
I hope you all rot in hell

00:16:22.022 --> 00:16:24.233
Ma'am, please, wait until...

00:16:59.349 --> 00:17:01.893
Okay,
let's start cleaning up, okay?

00:17:01.977 --> 00:17:04.646
Get the spilled bottles,
broken glass, stuff like that

00:17:04.729 --> 00:17:07.357
Aisle three has medical supplies

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.277
It's okay It's okay

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.028
All right, easy, champ
Come on

00:17:12.112 --> 00:17:13.113
Come on

00:17:13.196 --> 00:17:15.866
Come on
All right, hey, hey, hey

00:17:15.907 --> 00:17:17.576
Can't keep crying like this, pal

00:17:17.659 --> 00:17:18.994
Come on!

00:17:19.077 --> 00:17:21.037
Come on,
you’re gonna hurt yourself

00:17:21.121 --> 00:17:23.456
- Come on, are you all right?
- I want Mommy!

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.000
All right, I know you want Mommy

00:17:25.083 --> 00:17:27.585
All right, just try to breathe

00:17:27.626 --> 00:17:28.961
Just try to breathe, okay?

00:17:30.462 --> 00:17:32.298
Just try to breathe, pal
That's okay

00:17:32.381 --> 00:17:34.049
It's all right

00:17:36.635 --> 00:17:39.722
I haven't seen him suck his thumb
like this since he was 2 years old

00:17:39.805 --> 00:17:41.599
He's in shock

00:17:41.682 --> 00:17:43.392
I think we all are

00:17:43.475 --> 00:17:44.852
You haven't met

00:17:45.311 --> 00:17:46.770
Amanda Dunfrey

00:17:46.812 --> 00:17:48.981
She's new in town
as of this semester

00:17:49.982 --> 00:17:51.483
Teaches third grade

00:17:51.567 --> 00:17:54.819
and the specialed kids,
now that Mosher's retired

00:17:54.903 --> 00:17:56.821
She's wonderful
The kids love her

00:17:57.822 --> 00:17:59.991
And David's an artist

00:18:00.074 --> 00:18:03.036
He does movie posters and such

00:18:03.119 --> 00:18:04.078
And me

00:18:04.662 --> 00:18:09.584
Lord, I'm babbling away
like some old biddy at a tea party!

00:18:09.626 --> 00:18:11.127
My nerves are jangled, I guess

00:18:11.211 --> 00:18:12.420
Boy settle down?

00:18:12.504 --> 00:18:14.005
How is he?

00:18:14.088 --> 00:18:15.131
Still hot

00:18:15.215 --> 00:18:16.716
Why don't I get him some aspirin

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:18.635
- Aisle three
- Okay

00:18:18.718 --> 00:18:20.261
Thanks

00:18:20.303 --> 00:18:21.803
How's Dan?

00:18:21.887 --> 00:18:23.722
His nose stopped bleedin'

00:18:23.805 --> 00:18:26.099
He's calmer now
Somebody gave him a Valium

00:18:27.809 --> 00:18:29.269
Can't believe the way he ran in here

00:18:30.312 --> 00:18:31.438
Never seen him like that

00:18:31.522 --> 00:18:34.816
I need something to cover my boy up
Got any blankets?

00:18:35.651 --> 00:18:37.778
Furniture pads Loadin' dock

00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:40.906
Gonna keep checkin' on people
If you need anything, just holler

00:18:40.989 --> 00:18:43.075
You bet Sally, you mind?

00:18:43.158 --> 00:18:45.452
Oh, I'd love to. I really should
help him clean up

00:18:45.536 --> 00:18:47.955
- I'll take him
- Okay

00:18:47.996 --> 00:18:48.997
Daddy, don't go

00:18:49.081 --> 00:18:52.250
No, I'll be gone two seconds, Big Bill
Come on, I'm gonna get your blanket

00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:54.210
Mrs Reppler's here,

00:18:54.293 --> 00:18:56.295
and so is Mrs Turman

00:18:57.338 --> 00:18:58.798
I'll be close by, okay?

00:18:58.881 --> 00:19:01.467
- Okay
- Don’t worry, I'm not far Okay?

00:19:02.552 --> 00:19:03.553
Let me look at you

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.431
Hmm?

00:19:09.225 --> 00:19:10.309
Wanna lie down?

00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:11.352
Yeah

00:19:12.436 --> 00:19:13.688
There you go

00:19:13.771 --> 00:19:17.440
Soon as it blows away,
we can walk out of here safe andfree,

00:19:17.524 --> 00:19:18.942
but we have to be smart about it

00:19:19.025 --> 00:19:21.653
First thing we need to do
is keep our wits about us

00:19:21.736 --> 00:19:23.321
and find out what’s happened

00:19:23.363 --> 00:19:24.865
Well, how we gonna
do that, my man?

00:19:24.948 --> 00:19:27.534
We've got no phone signal,
got no radio

00:19:27.617 --> 00:19:30.162
I'm sure they're working
on those problems as we speak

00:19:30.245 --> 00:19:32.497
It stands to reason
that restoring communications

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:33.540
would be their top priority

00:19:46.427 --> 00:19:48.512
Jeez!

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.201
Oh, shit.

00:20:11.702 --> 00:20:13.161
Ow!

00:20:15.163 --> 00:20:16.164
Shit!

00:20:20.502 --> 00:20:21.669
God damn it!

00:20:21.753 --> 00:20:23.713
Ow! Ow!

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.925
Bitch!

00:20:27.008 --> 00:20:28.176
It's obvious that we’re...

00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:30.220
we're in some kind
of natural disaster here

00:20:30.303 --> 00:20:32.931
Ain't nothin' obvious
about this sombitch from where I sit

00:20:33.014 --> 00:20:35.350
There ain't nothin'
natural about it either

00:20:35.433 --> 00:20:36.392
That's right

00:20:36.476 --> 00:20:39.145
It's Judgment Day,
and it's come round at last

00:20:39.229 --> 00:20:41.688
There is nothing more obvious
or natural than that

00:20:41.772 --> 00:20:43.273
Ohh, fuck, now

00:20:43.357 --> 00:20:45.025
You've done that to yourself,

00:20:45.108 --> 00:20:46.985
by a life of sin and dissolution

00:21:33.322 --> 00:21:34.991
Hey, whoa! David!

00:21:35.073 --> 00:21:37.450
Hey, you guys hear that?

00:21:37.492 --> 00:21:39.411
The generator?
We're just gonna check it out

00:21:39.494 --> 00:21:41.329
No, no, I turned the generator off

00:21:41.413 --> 00:21:43.415
It... it was backing up

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.419
- N-nobody else heard that sound?
- What sound?

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.132
I don't know, like a weird noise,

00:21:52.174 --> 00:21:53.967
back there in the dark

00:21:54.009 --> 00:21:56.511
Like something was, like,
pressing against the door

00:21:56.595 --> 00:22:00.140
Did you hear it
before the lights went out, or after?

00:22:00.182 --> 00:22:02.058
No, only after

00:22:02.142 --> 00:22:04.393
After, but, look, I heard it, okay?

00:22:04.476 --> 00:22:06.520
- Nobody's calling you a liar
- That's what it sounds like

00:22:06.604 --> 00:22:09.273
No, no, no, no
Now, don't be that away, Mr Drayton on

00:22:09.356 --> 00:22:11.400
You had a scare, no doubt

00:22:11.484 --> 00:22:13.152
What say we all go check it out?

00:22:13.194 --> 00:22:14.653
Here

00:22:20.326 --> 00:22:22.578
Oooopf!

00:22:22.661 --> 00:22:23.621
Man.

00:22:23.704 --> 00:22:25.831
It's pretty rank in here

00:22:25.873 --> 00:22:28.000
- Myron, go check it out
- All right

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.253
Go on, fire it up

00:22:40.929 --> 00:22:43.264
All right!

00:22:43.348 --> 00:22:44.432
Shut it off!

00:22:45.517 --> 00:22:47.227
Holy crow, don't that stink!

00:22:48.144 --> 00:22:49.562
Something's
got the exhaust vent

00:22:49.646 --> 00:22:51.272
plugged up from the outside

00:22:51.356 --> 00:22:53.775
You get it running long enough
to raise that door a little,

00:22:53.858 --> 00:22:55.318
I'll go out and clear
whatever's blockin' it

00:22:55.401 --> 00:22:56.569
No, no, you can't do that

00:22:56.653 --> 00:22:58.654
Why not?
It's an electric door, right?

00:22:58.737 --> 00:23:01.698
Well, yeah, but it may not be wise
to send him out there

00:23:01.782 --> 00:23:03.116
Okay, I'll do it

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.077
No, look, it's not about
who goes out there

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.162
What, don't you think I can do it?

00:23:07.246 --> 00:23:09.873
Hey! I want to go!
It was my idea

00:23:09.915 --> 00:23:11.416
Well, wait, just stop, okay?

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.085
J-Jim, right?

00:23:13.168 --> 00:23:15.671
Myron? You guys are...

00:23:15.754 --> 00:23:17.840
you, well, you don't seem
to understand,

00:23:17.923 --> 00:23:19.466
or you’re try in' real hard not to

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.218
This is no ordinary mist, okay?

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.429
You open that door,
and something gets in here

00:23:24.513 --> 00:23:25.680
Like what?

00:23:26.973 --> 00:23:28.891
Well, like whatever
made that noise I heard

00:23:28.933 --> 00:23:30.434
Are you guys being will fully dense?

00:23:30.518 --> 00:23:32.854
Mr Drayton on, you’ll pardon me,

00:23:32.937 --> 00:23:36.566
but I'm not convinced
that you heard anything

00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:38.484
I mean, we're not
hearing anything now, right?

00:23:38.568 --> 00:23:39.527
Anybody?

00:23:40.903 --> 00:23:41.863
See?

00:23:43.239 --> 00:23:46.242
Now, I know, I know...
you’re a big shot artist

00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:48.828
with connections in New York
and Hollywood and all like that,

00:23:48.911 --> 00:23:51.205
but that don't make you better
than anybody else, not in my book

00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:52.623
Hey, I didn't say that

00:23:52.707 --> 00:23:55.041
Nor do I like being talked down to
or called stupid

00:23:55.125 --> 00:23:58.086
by a guy who went to college,
just 'cause he's got the jitters

00:23:58.128 --> 00:24:00.297
Fellas, it doesn't even matter
about the generator

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.756
The food'll keep without it

00:24:01.798 --> 00:24:04.551
Kid, I'm gonna start the motor,
you raise the door,

00:24:04.634 --> 00:24:06.261
and you yell out
when you got enough room

00:24:06.303 --> 00:24:07.846
Yeah Okay, good

00:24:07.929 --> 00:24:09.681
Wait

00:24:09.764 --> 00:24:10.724
This is...

00:24:10.807 --> 00:24:12.726
You guys gonna let
this kid risk his life

00:24:12.809 --> 00:24:14.519
over a generator
that doesn't even matter?

00:24:14.603 --> 00:24:16.021
Would you just
shut the fuck up already?

00:24:16.104 --> 00:24:17.063
Norm!

00:24:17.147 --> 00:24:19.149
Listen, Mr Drayton on,
I tell you what

00:24:19.232 --> 00:24:21.233
The next time
you got somethin' to say,

00:24:21.317 --> 00:24:22.651
you count your teeth,

00:24:22.735 --> 00:24:26.071
because I'm sick to death
of your bullshit

00:24:26.155 --> 00:24:27.615
All right?

00:24:27.698 --> 00:24:28.699
Come on, Myron

00:24:28.782 --> 00:24:30.451
This is crazy!
Leave 'em be

00:24:30.493 --> 00:24:32.495
What am I, impugning
their manhood or something?

00:24:33.037 --> 00:24:35.039
Listen, they've lost
their sense of proportion

00:24:35.122 --> 00:24:36.457
What's going on here?

00:24:36.499 --> 00:24:38.292
Out there in the market,
they were scared and confused

00:24:38.334 --> 00:24:40.336
In here, there's a problem
they can solve,

00:24:40.419 --> 00:24:42.463
so they're goddamn gonna solve it

00:24:42.505 --> 00:24:44.006
Ready, kid?
- Let's rock

00:24:44.089 --> 00:24:45.466
Norm, come on

00:24:45.508 --> 00:24:46.509
Don't, man

00:24:50.887 --> 00:24:52.055
It's a mistake

00:24:56.684 --> 00:24:57.811
Pussy

00:25:02.315 --> 00:25:03.441
Go up!

00:25:25.629 --> 00:25:26.755
So

00:25:26.839 --> 00:25:28.298
any boogeymen?

00:25:31.218 --> 00:25:32.719
Pretty scary, ain't it, Norm?

00:25:32.803 --> 00:25:34.847
Yeah, right

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.101
Norm

00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:41.854
Norm!

00:25:41.937 --> 00:25:43.230
What the fuck!

00:25:43.313 --> 00:25:44.856
Get it off! Get it off!

00:25:44.939 --> 00:25:46.858
Get this friggin' thing off me!

00:25:46.899 --> 00:25:48.651
Get it off! Help me!

00:25:48.818 --> 00:25:50.528
Help me! Help me!

00:25:52.113 --> 00:25:53.531
Jesus!

00:26:03.749 --> 00:26:06.752
There's more! There's more!

00:26:07.336 --> 00:26:08.754
Somebody help me

00:26:10.798 --> 00:26:12.299
Somebody help me

00:26:12.382 --> 00:26:14.050
What the fuck are you waitin' for?

00:26:26.438 --> 00:26:27.814
Hang on!

00:26:37.532 --> 00:26:40.743
Hold him still!
Hold him still!

00:26:48.709 --> 00:26:50.711
Oh, Jesus!

00:27:24.118 --> 00:27:25.787
Shit! Oh, shit!

00:27:25.829 --> 00:27:27.956
Oh, shit!

00:27:29.707 --> 00:27:31.876
David, it's no good!

00:27:33.002 --> 00:27:34.504
Start the generator

00:28:43.737 --> 00:28:45.030
Hey, I'm sorry

00:28:48.074 --> 00:28:49.201
I mean, how the...

00:28:49.284 --> 00:28:51.328
how the hell was I supposed
to know what you meant?

00:28:52.746 --> 00:28:54.372
You said you heard something

00:28:55.707 --> 00:28:57.167
How was I supposed to know
what you meant?

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:58.459
You should've said
what you meant better

00:28:58.542 --> 00:29:02.004
I don't know, I thought maybe
it was a big bird or something

00:29:02.588 --> 00:29:04.465
You got that kid killed!

00:29:04.548 --> 00:29:06.509
Did you get a good look at it? Huh?

00:29:06.592 --> 00:29:09.720
Did you get a good look
at what you did?

00:29:09.804 --> 00:29:11.013
- Huh?
- David!

00:29:11.096 --> 00:29:12.389
Don't hit him any more!
Doesn't solve anything!

00:29:12.473 --> 00:29:15.309
You two assholes,
you got that kid killed!

00:29:15.392 --> 00:29:17.353
And I got his fuckin' blood on me!

00:29:37.121 --> 00:29:39.249
Okay, I'm done

00:29:41.376 --> 00:29:42.377
Okay

00:29:45.463 --> 00:29:46.923
What's next?

00:29:47.966 --> 00:29:49.467
Kill the generator

00:29:49.968 --> 00:29:51.136
That's the first thing

00:29:55.055 --> 00:29:56.431
I'm sorry

00:30:01.103 --> 00:30:03.230
Jesus Christ! Oh, God!

00:30:03.313 --> 00:30:05.858
I'm... I'm sorry about the kid

00:30:07.901 --> 00:30:10.112
Oh, God Oh, God Oh, God

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:12.865
We oughtta get out of here

00:30:17.244 --> 00:30:18.537
Hey, we didn't twist his arm

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.914
Yeah, he's a fuckin' kid
He's supposed to be stupid

00:30:22.915 --> 00:30:24.834
What's your excuse, huh?

00:30:28.004 --> 00:30:29.338
Get outta here

00:30:30.423 --> 00:30:32.258
Go back in the market
Stay by the door

00:30:34.594 --> 00:30:36.554
Don't say anything, to anybody

00:30:38.097 --> 00:30:39.140
Not yet

00:30:40.725 --> 00:30:41.726
Not yet

00:30:56.781 --> 00:30:57.782
Shit

00:30:57.866 --> 00:31:01.077
David? Need a little light here

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.673
We have to tell 'em

00:31:13.757 --> 00:31:16.592
The people in the market,
we have to stop 'em going outside

00:31:17.885 --> 00:31:19.220
They won't believe us

00:31:20.554 --> 00:31:21.514
They have to

00:31:21.597 --> 00:31:23.849
I'm not sure I believe it
I was here.

00:31:24.892 --> 00:31:27.019
W- what we saw was impossible

00:31:27.061 --> 00:31:29.021
You know that, don't you?

00:31:29.063 --> 00:31:30.064
I mean, what...

00:31:31.732 --> 00:31:33.067
what do we say?

00:31:34.068 --> 00:31:36.737
How do we convince them?

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:43.743
Ollie, what the hell were
those tentacles even attached to?

00:31:49.582 --> 00:31:51.918
Oh, my God!
Are... are you all right?

00:31:52.001 --> 00:31:54.504
Shh! Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's not my blood I'm fine

00:31:54.587 --> 00:31:55.880
W- what the hell happened?

00:31:55.964 --> 00:31:57.757
I'll explain Give me a minute, okay?

00:31:57.841 --> 00:31:59.843
I need to deal with something first

00:32:01.761 --> 00:32:03.346
Please, I've got to...

00:32:03.429 --> 00:32:06.141
I can't let Billy see me like this
He's scared enough

00:32:06.224 --> 00:32:09.060
Just give me a minute
Keep him distracted Okay?

00:32:09.144 --> 00:32:10.145
Okay

00:32:15.899 --> 00:32:18.819
Hey, look,
I'm sorry about Norm

00:32:18.902 --> 00:32:20.237
Me too

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.739
I mean, I ain't makin' excuses,
I'm just sayin'

00:32:22.781 --> 00:32:24.074
Look, we need to tell people

00:32:24.158 --> 00:32:26.660
No need to say how it went down
or anything like that,

00:32:26.743 --> 00:32:29.496
but, uh, we're in the deep shit here

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.039
People need to know

00:32:31.123 --> 00:32:32.666
What about the out-of-towners?

00:32:32.749 --> 00:32:35.502
We got plenty of them in the store
Where do we even start?

00:32:35.586 --> 00:32:37.796
Brent Norton?
That windbag?

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.590
He's an important attorney
in New York

00:32:40.673 --> 00:32:42.842
That fellow could be
on the bench one day

00:32:42.925 --> 00:32:45.386
Counts a lot with people of this town,
or... or any here

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.013
Yeah, that's right
- Do it quick, David

00:32:47.096 --> 00:32:50.016
We've got to discuss how we’re gonna
stop that thing getting in here

00:32:50.099 --> 00:32:51.851
W- wait What do you mean
getting in?

00:32:52.435 --> 00:32:53.936
You shut the loading door

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.607
Yeah, but the entire front of the store
is plate glass

00:33:01.444 --> 00:33:03.404
Jesus Christ

00:33:13.997 --> 00:33:15.791
I was wondering
where you’d gotten to

00:33:15.874 --> 00:33:17.375
Um, listen

00:33:17.459 --> 00:33:20.212
that guy that came in here,
the one with the bloody nose

00:33:25.717 --> 00:33:29.221
they're... they're...
We saw tentacles.

00:33:29.304 --> 00:33:30.722
Ain't goin' very well, is it?

00:33:31.723 --> 00:33:33.266
Unh-unh

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.851
- You what?
- Come here, you’ve got...

00:33:37.061 --> 00:33:38.270
Come here

00:33:40.356 --> 00:33:41.315
Tell him

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.401
It's true

00:33:51.242 --> 00:33:53.661
Tentacles Yeah

00:34:02.836 --> 00:34:04.295
Um, gentlemen, um

00:34:05.547 --> 00:34:08.133
I'm sorry, I...
I'm just not that stupid

00:34:08.216 --> 00:34:09.592
I mean, what do you take me for?

00:34:09.676 --> 00:34:11.344
I'm shocked

00:34:12.428 --> 00:34:13.429
I'm shocked

00:34:13.513 --> 00:34:15.640
I'm shocked It's pretty tasteless

00:34:15.723 --> 00:34:17.684
using what's happening here
to try to make me look like an idiot

00:34:17.767 --> 00:34:19.435
No, no, that's not
what's going on here

00:34:19.519 --> 00:34:21.479
Look, come back
to the loading dock, okay?

00:34:21.563 --> 00:34:22.522
I'll show you

00:34:22.605 --> 00:34:26.192
Blood A chunk of tentacle
on... on the floor

00:34:26.276 --> 00:34:27.277
No

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.028
No? What do you mean no?

00:34:29.112 --> 00:34:31.280
No We've got real problems
to deal with here,

00:34:31.363 --> 00:34:34.533
and this pathetic attempt at a joke

00:34:34.575 --> 00:34:36.535
has gone far enough

00:34:36.577 --> 00:34:39.580
Mr Norton, what reason
could we possibly have...?

00:34:39.663 --> 00:34:41.290
Oh, please! Please!

00:34:41.373 --> 00:34:43.834
This is pay back for the lawsuit
that I filed against him last year,

00:34:43.917 --> 00:34:45.752
and you guys are backing him up

00:34:45.836 --> 00:34:47.504
So winning wasn't enough, huh?

00:34:47.588 --> 00:34:49.756
You wanted to humiliate me
some more,

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.176
show me a rubber snake
while these... these hicks

00:34:52.259 --> 00:34:53.552
stand around laughing their asses off

00:34:53.635 --> 00:34:54.887
- Watch who you callin' a hick!
- Myron! Myron!

00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:56.847
- Hey, hey, fuck...!
Mr Norton

00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:59.515
I swear, you have
got us all wrong

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:04.061
You're not too crazy about,
um, out-of-towners, are you?

00:35:05.146 --> 00:35:07.190
I only spend my money,
and I pay my taxes here,

00:35:07.273 --> 00:35:11.110
and I have seen you
talking behind my back

00:35:12.528 --> 00:35:13.946
Y'all stick together

00:35:17.283 --> 00:35:18.951
Well, don't I feel foolish?

00:35:19.035 --> 00:35:21.537
I actually thought you were
being kind to me today,

00:35:21.621 --> 00:35:23.080
and, well, thanks
for setting me straight

00:35:23.164 --> 00:35:25.332
And I'm glad that tree fell
on your boathouse, you know that?

00:35:25.415 --> 00:35:27.793
Glad Smashed it in
pretty good, didn't it? Fantastic

00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:29.461
Now, all of y'all,
just stay out of my way

00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:32.088
I know you’re scared, man
I'm scared too

00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:34.257
- Lives are at stake around here
- David...

00:35:34.299 --> 00:35:36.635
Okay, my son's life
Now, I need you.

00:35:36.718 --> 00:35:40.263
Brent, please,
get your head out of your ass

00:35:40.347 --> 00:35:42.432
All right, I'll drag you
back there if I have to

00:35:42.474 --> 00:35:43.475
Come here

00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:46.561
David, get your goddamn hands
off of me!

00:35:46.645 --> 00:35:48.563
I'll sue your ass again!

00:35:48.647 --> 00:35:50.899
Sue your ass, and this time
you’ll go to jail!

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:52.441
This man assaulted me

00:35:52.525 --> 00:35:55.152
He assaulted me
You were witness to it

00:35:55.236 --> 00:35:56.237
This man's crazy
He's crazy

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.947
No

00:35:57.988 --> 00:36:00.407
He isn't I wish he was, but he isn't

00:36:02.618 --> 00:36:06.747
E- every one in the store,
you want to come back here?

00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:10.459
There's something you need to hear
It concerns you all

00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:11.794
Okay

00:36:11.877 --> 00:36:14.880
W- w-wait I don't know
what you people think you’re doing

00:36:14.964 --> 00:36:16.423
You're drinking?

00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:18.008
For Christ's sake, Ollie

00:36:19.009 --> 00:36:22.137
Do you want me to report you?
You want to lose your job?

00:36:22.178 --> 00:36:24.097
Look, I'm gonna be taking down
names, starting with you

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.141
And I am prepared to file
a police report

00:36:26.182 --> 00:36:28.184
- Fine, Bud, write down your names
- I will

00:36:28.268 --> 00:36:31.104
But in the meantime,
shut the fuck up and listen

00:36:32.897 --> 00:36:34.149
This is Mr David Drayton on

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:37.527
You need to hear what he's got to say
if you’re thinking about leaving

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.279
go hang out
with the ladies, all right?

00:36:39.362 --> 00:36:40.655
Listen, don't be scared

00:36:42.866 --> 00:36:43.825
It's okay

00:36:46.035 --> 00:36:47.036
Okay

00:36:48.203 --> 00:36:49.538
This is how it is

00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:52.040
Now, I don't know
what this mist is

00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:55.294
but there are things in it, and they're
dangerous, like Dan said

00:36:55.377 --> 00:36:56.336
That's right

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.755
That's exactly right

00:36:58.839 --> 00:37:00.674
What kind of things?

00:37:00.757 --> 00:37:02.759
I never saw it
It happened too fast

00:37:02.843 --> 00:37:04.636
I got knocked down

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.847
Five of us went back
in the loading dock

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.517
It was Jim, Myron, Ollie

00:37:10.601 --> 00:37:12.269
me

00:37:12.352 --> 00:37:13.812
Norm, the bagboy

00:37:13.896 --> 00:37:15.396
- We opened the door
- Where's Norm?

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:19.192
So Norm could go out
and clear the vent for the generator

00:37:20.526 --> 00:37:22.153
Something come out of the mist
and took him

00:37:22.236 --> 00:37:23.196
Took him?

00:37:23.279 --> 00:37:24.864
What do you mean?

00:37:26.449 --> 00:37:27.617
Just killed him

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.535
I mean dragged him off

00:37:29.619 --> 00:37:34.207
Now, guys, I don't know
what these things are

00:37:35.249 --> 00:37:36.751
All we saw were tentacles

00:37:40.713 --> 00:37:41.672
Tentacles?

00:37:44.883 --> 00:37:46.468
Tentacles, he say

00:37:47.052 --> 00:37:49.137
Tentacles from Planet X

00:37:49.221 --> 00:37:50.555
It's a lie, you know

00:37:50.597 --> 00:37:53.725
I mean, all these people do
is just lie each other up

00:37:53.809 --> 00:37:55.060
It's a pile of shit

00:37:55.101 --> 00:37:56.603
Of course it's a lie
Of course it's a lie

00:37:56.686 --> 00:37:57.687
It's lunacy

00:37:58.688 --> 00:38:01.233
From the look of it, the tentacles
are coming out of the beer cans

00:38:01.316 --> 00:38:03.026
All right, uh, Bud,
don't take our word for it

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:04.069
Go look

00:38:10.825 --> 00:38:11.826
Over there

00:38:17.498 --> 00:38:18.999
What the hell is that?

00:38:51.489 --> 00:38:54.784
It appears we may have a problem
of some magnitude here

00:39:11.008 --> 00:39:12.468
Yeah, just keep 'em in line
Thanks

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.147
Let me

00:39:27.357 --> 00:39:30.694
help these people

00:39:30.778 --> 00:39:32.613
Let me...

00:39:32.696 --> 00:39:34.655
let me preach your word

00:39:36.699 --> 00:39:39.118
Let me shine your light,

00:39:39.202 --> 00:39:41.662
'cause they're not all bad

00:39:42.705 --> 00:39:44.999
They can't all be bad

00:39:48.044 --> 00:39:51.964
Some can be saved, can't they?

00:39:52.048 --> 00:39:53.800
Yes

00:39:53.883 --> 00:39:55.343
Some can be brought

00:39:56.385 --> 00:39:59.639
to heaven's holy gates
through your grace

00:39:59.722 --> 00:40:00.932
I have to believe that,

00:40:01.015 --> 00:40:05.393
though I know most will swim
in the lake of fire forever

00:40:09.064 --> 00:40:10.690
If I can save a few

00:40:12.067 --> 00:40:14.027
even one

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:17.531
then my life will have counted
for something

00:40:18.573 --> 00:40:21.368
I will have pulled my weight

00:40:21.451 --> 00:40:24.830
I will have earned my place
at your side

00:40:24.913 --> 00:40:29.208
I will have served a purpose
here on this earth

00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:30.793
Hello?

00:40:46.934 --> 00:40:48.185
What?

00:40:48.269 --> 00:40:50.479
I just need to use the bathroom

00:40:50.563 --> 00:40:51.522
Oh

00:40:52.773 --> 00:40:55.151
Okay Well, then, have at it

00:40:59.446 --> 00:41:00.697
Ma'am

00:41:01.781 --> 00:41:05.618
I... I just want you to know
that it's okay...

00:41:05.702 --> 00:41:07.370
being scared, I mean...

00:41:07.454 --> 00:41:09.998
and, well, if you need a friend...

00:41:10.081 --> 00:41:12.500
you know, someone to talk to

00:41:12.584 --> 00:41:14.544
I have a friend...

00:41:14.627 --> 00:41:18.548
God up above
I talk to him every day

00:41:18.631 --> 00:41:20.592
Don't you condescend to me

00:41:20.675 --> 00:41:21.801
I'm sorry?

00:41:21.885 --> 00:41:25.429
Not ever
You don't mock me

00:41:25.471 --> 00:41:27.097
That's not what I was doing

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.100
Well, I'll tell you what...

00:41:30.184 --> 00:41:32.019
the day I need a friend like you,

00:41:32.102 --> 00:41:35.147
I'll just have my self a little squat
and shit one out

00:41:40.986 --> 00:41:42.654
Maybe you do believe this

00:41:42.738 --> 00:41:45.824
Maybe they're not lies,
they're delusions Whatever

00:41:45.908 --> 00:41:49.119
Uh, the fact remains,
the evidence here is flimsy

00:41:49.203 --> 00:41:51.246
- It's bordering on ludicrous
- Hey, this isn't a courtroom

00:41:52.246 --> 00:41:53.247
You're not arguing a case,

00:41:53.331 --> 00:41:54.874
and you’re doing nothing but damage,
talking the way you are

00:41:54.957 --> 00:41:57.919
And you can throw as much cow's blood
around the loading dock as you want to

00:41:58.002 --> 00:41:59.462
You still haven't fooled any one

00:41:59.504 --> 00:42:00.588
Leave it alone, David

00:42:00.671 --> 00:42:02.340
You can't convince
some people there's a fire

00:42:02.423 --> 00:42:04.425
even when their hair is burning

00:42:04.509 --> 00:42:05.968
Denial is a powerful thing

00:42:06.052 --> 00:42:07.053
Well, keep talking

00:42:07.136 --> 00:42:10.473
I'll have no part of it,
nor would any thinking person

00:42:10.515 --> 00:42:13.226
Keep thinking, Mr Lawyer

00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:16.229
There's no defence
against the will of God

00:42:16.312 --> 00:42:18.481
There's no court of appeals in hell

00:42:18.564 --> 00:42:20.982
There's no defence here, either

00:42:21.024 --> 00:42:23.276
Not even with all the fertilizer
in the world,

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.821
not even if you stack it
as high as you can

00:42:25.904 --> 00:42:28.448
It's still just bags of shit, isn't it?

00:42:28.532 --> 00:42:30.492
Those of you who want to discuss
this thing rationally

00:42:30.575 --> 00:42:34.621
to find a means of rescue
are welcome to join me

00:42:34.704 --> 00:42:37.332
Those who want to stack dog food,

00:42:37.415 --> 00:42:38.959
knock yourselves out

00:42:42.712 --> 00:42:45.048
We got those windows taped up
as best we could

00:42:45.132 --> 00:42:46.299
It should help

00:42:46.383 --> 00:42:47.675
Yeah, think so?

00:42:49.718 --> 00:42:51.554
Duct tape and dog food bags

00:42:53.764 --> 00:42:55.099
That bad?

00:42:55.182 --> 00:42:56.142
It's not good

00:42:56.225 --> 00:42:59.395
There's none so blind
as those who will not see

00:43:00.688 --> 00:43:02.273
Open your eyes

00:43:02.356 --> 00:43:04.608
Let the scales fall away

00:43:04.692 --> 00:43:06.652
This has all been written

00:43:08.195 --> 00:43:11.532
Revelations, chapter 15:

00:43:11.574 --> 00:43:13.909
"And the temple was filled with smoke

00:43:13.993 --> 00:43:16.161
"from the glory of God

00:43:16.244 --> 00:43:17.620
"and from his power,

00:43:17.704 --> 00:43:19.164
"and no one could enter the temple

00:43:19.247 --> 00:43:23.251
until the seven plagues
of the seven angels were completed"

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:25.628
Well, what are you saying?

00:43:25.712 --> 00:43:27.046
What are you proposing?

00:43:27.088 --> 00:43:28.715
That we all prepare

00:43:30.216 --> 00:43:31.593
to meet our Maker

00:43:31.676 --> 00:43:33.845
Oh, prepare to meet shit!

00:43:34.888 --> 00:43:37.390
Lady, your tongue
must be hung in the middle

00:43:37.474 --> 00:43:39.392
so that it can waggle at both ends

00:43:39.434 --> 00:43:41.227
The end time has come,

00:43:41.269 --> 00:43:43.061
not in flames, but in mist

00:43:43.103 --> 00:43:44.104
Come here!

00:43:44.188 --> 00:43:45.314
Easy! Back off!

00:43:45.397 --> 00:43:48.400
How about if your ass prepares
to meet my size-10 work boot

00:43:48.484 --> 00:43:49.485
How about that?

00:43:49.568 --> 00:43:51.028
Hey, there's no call for that

00:43:51.111 --> 00:43:53.697
Myron, please,
calm your friend down

00:43:53.781 --> 00:43:56.533
I'm trying
to save your soul, you stupid man

00:43:56.617 --> 00:43:58.786
- Doubters will doubt till the end
- It's okay

00:43:58.869 --> 00:43:59.912
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

00:43:59.995 --> 00:44:02.581
A monstrosity did pull
that poor boy away

00:44:03.165 --> 00:44:06.543
Things in the mist...
do you doubt?

00:44:06.627 --> 00:44:07.586
Do you?

00:44:09.171 --> 00:44:11.089
Then go out

00:44:11.172 --> 00:44:13.549
Go out and say,
"How do you do"

00:44:13.633 --> 00:44:14.592
Shut up, lady

00:44:16.344 --> 00:44:17.553
For God's sakes

00:44:17.637 --> 00:44:19.764
Look, you’ll have to stop now
You're scaring the children

00:44:19.847 --> 00:44:21.265
They should be scared

00:44:21.307 --> 00:44:24.018
Oh, yes, they should

00:44:25.019 --> 00:44:27.563
Their beautiful, pure little minds

00:44:27.647 --> 00:44:30.108
have been corrupted with lies

00:44:30.191 --> 00:44:31.192
Lies

00:44:31.275 --> 00:44:33.361
All this talk of a modern God,

00:44:33.444 --> 00:44:36.114
or no God

00:44:36.197 --> 00:44:37.864
There is one God

00:44:37.948 --> 00:44:39.616
The God of the Israelites

00:44:39.658 --> 00:44:42.494
And he is a stern and vengeful God,

00:44:42.577 --> 00:44:45.122
and we have been mocking him
far too long,

00:44:45.205 --> 00:44:48.875
and now he demands
retribution in blood

00:44:48.959 --> 00:44:51.628
It is time to declare yourselves

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:53.338
Take sides...

00:44:53.422 --> 00:44:55.257
the saved and the damned

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.802
Read the Good Book
It calls for expiation

00:44:58.885 --> 00:45:00.720
- Blood!
- What?

00:45:00.804 --> 00:45:01.763
Blood

00:45:03.014 --> 00:45:04.641
Little Normie was first,

00:45:04.724 --> 00:45:07.810
and now God calls the rest of us

00:45:07.852 --> 00:45:09.353
The bill is due

00:45:09.437 --> 00:45:10.938
It must be paid

00:45:11.021 --> 00:45:13.983
As Abraham prepared
to sacrifice his only son

00:45:14.066 --> 00:45:15.568
to prove his love for God, so...

00:45:15.651 --> 00:45:16.819
Enough

00:45:23.033 --> 00:45:25.453
- Ohh
- Another down payment

00:45:25.536 --> 00:45:26.996
A few more pennies in the jar

00:45:27.037 --> 00:45:28.080
Now, that's nice, see

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.082
I can't smack her,
but it's okay for you

00:45:30.166 --> 00:45:31.500
I- I'm sorry every body,

00:45:31.542 --> 00:45:34.544
but this lady's perspective is
a little too Old Testament for my taste

00:45:34.627 --> 00:45:36.129
They'll come for you

00:45:37.172 --> 00:45:39.632
Maybe tonight,
when darkness comes

00:45:41.217 --> 00:45:44.095
They'll come tonight,
and they'll take someone else

00:45:44.179 --> 00:45:46.139
See if they don't

00:45:46.222 --> 00:45:47.974
And when they do,

00:45:48.057 --> 00:45:50.685
you will cry to God,

00:45:50.727 --> 00:45:54.397
and you will beg Mother Carmody
to show you the way

00:45:54.481 --> 00:45:55.815
That's fine

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.152
But until then,
if you don't shut up,

00:45:59.235 --> 00:46:01.195
I'll wrap this tape around your mouth

00:46:01.278 --> 00:46:03.614
You just try it, Ollie Weeks

00:46:03.697 --> 00:46:05.157
And you, bitch

00:46:06.658 --> 00:46:08.160
you hit me again

00:46:09.161 --> 00:46:10.329
if you dare

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:13.999
You'll be on your knees to me
before this is through

00:46:20.756 --> 00:46:22.549
Those of you who aren't local
should know

00:46:22.591 --> 00:46:25.427
that Mrs Carmody
is known in town for being

00:46:26.512 --> 00:46:27.513
unstable

00:46:27.596 --> 00:46:30.973
No shit
What was your first clue?

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:35.520
Shh

00:46:36.604 --> 00:46:38.397
Hi

00:46:38.481 --> 00:46:39.649
What's up, little dude?

00:46:39.732 --> 00:46:41.526
How come your friends
don't come get us?

00:46:41.609 --> 00:46:43.069
They got tanks and stuff, right?

00:46:44.529 --> 00:46:45.905
Why can't you just call 'em?

00:46:45.988 --> 00:46:47.156
Phones don’t work

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.991
But don't you got, like, a radio?

00:46:49.075 --> 00:46:50.535
Hey, champ, what's going on?

00:46:50.618 --> 00:46:52.745
I want their friends
to come rescue us

00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:54.831
They would if they could, pal
They're stuck here just like us

00:46:54.914 --> 00:46:55.873
But...

00:46:55.957 --> 00:46:57.833
Shh Now, guys, we could use
a hand over there

00:46:57.916 --> 00:46:58.875
Yeah, sure thing

00:46:58.959 --> 00:47:00.419
Troop, off your asses

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:03.547
You all right?
- I don't like that scary lady

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:05.924
Oh, man, I don't either

00:47:06.007 --> 00:47:07.467
But you know what?

00:47:08.468 --> 00:47:10.262
Maybe she's scared too

00:47:11.304 --> 00:47:12.264
You think?

00:47:13.306 --> 00:47:14.808
You think Mommy's okay?

00:47:15.809 --> 00:47:18.145
Billy

00:47:21.022 --> 00:47:23.191
I'm sorry about the times
I was bad to her

00:47:23.275 --> 00:47:24.233
Aw, hey

00:47:25.317 --> 00:47:28.446
Mommy loves you very much

00:47:28.487 --> 00:47:29.989
And I'll bet she's fine

00:47:31.824 --> 00:47:33.826
And I promise you,

00:47:33.909 --> 00:47:37.079
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get us back to her

00:47:38.664 --> 00:47:40.040
- Okay?
- 'Kay

00:47:41.125 --> 00:47:42.543
- Yeah?
- 'Kay

00:47:43.544 --> 00:47:46.380
So, we can use the charcoal fluid
and the mops

00:47:46.464 --> 00:47:47.798
to make torches

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.717
And we've got knives and stuff,
God knows

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.177
This maybe
a silly question, Bud, but

00:47:53.178 --> 00:47:55.013
do you happen to have
a gun in the store?

00:47:56.014 --> 00:47:57.849
Here? No Please

00:47:57.932 --> 00:47:59.642
This... this isn't Los Angeles

00:47:59.726 --> 00:48:01.394
I've got a shotgun in my truck

00:48:02.729 --> 00:48:04.230
I could try for it if you want

00:48:04.314 --> 00:48:06.566
Oh, God, I don't think that'd be
a good idea, Mr Cornell

00:48:06.649 --> 00:48:07.609
Hold on

00:48:10.153 --> 00:48:11.613
This gun, um

00:48:11.696 --> 00:48:13.573
my husband's idea

00:48:13.656 --> 00:48:15.617
He's away on business a lot

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:16.868
It's not even loaded

00:48:16.951 --> 00:48:18.578
Ain't much use unloaded, ma'am

00:48:18.661 --> 00:48:19.620
Um

00:48:23.332 --> 00:48:24.750
You know how to use that?

00:48:24.833 --> 00:48:26.418
Well, I shot it once on a pistol range

00:48:26.502 --> 00:48:27.961
Hit the target a few times

00:48:29.004 --> 00:48:31.590
So, we got a gun

00:48:31.673 --> 00:48:33.592
Anybody know how to shoot it?

00:48:33.675 --> 00:48:35.010
Well, I mean?

00:48:35.094 --> 00:48:36.095
I do

00:48:38.889 --> 00:48:39.848
You?

00:48:39.932 --> 00:48:42.768
Ollie Please

00:48:48.106 --> 00:48:50.024
Some target shooting

00:48:50.066 --> 00:48:52.276
State champion in '94

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.195
You're crazy if you go out there!
Let us pass!

00:48:54.278 --> 00:48:56.197
Let us pass, please!

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.281
Let's just talk this thing through

00:48:57.365 --> 00:48:59.534
We have, and we've
made our decision We're leaving

00:48:59.575 --> 00:49:02.620
Hey, Mr Mackey's gonna barbecue
some chicken on the gas grill

00:49:02.703 --> 00:49:03.913
Why don’t we just
sit down and just...

00:49:03.913 --> 00:49:05.039
What, and let you keep on talking?

00:49:05.081 --> 00:49:07.208
No, I've been in far too many
courtrooms to fall for that

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:09.377
You've already psyched out
half a dozen of my people already

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:10.461
Your people?

00:49:10.545 --> 00:49:12.380
What kind of talk is that?
They're people, that's all

00:49:12.422 --> 00:49:13.881
Now... now listen, every one

00:49:13.923 --> 00:49:16.925
We are experiencing
some kind of disaster

00:49:17.008 --> 00:49:19.010
I don't know whether
it's manmade or natural,

00:49:19.094 --> 00:49:22.973
but I do know that
it's definitely not supernatural

00:49:23.056 --> 00:49:25.350
or biblical,
and, no offense, Mrs Carmody,

00:49:25.434 --> 00:49:27.060
but the only way
we're gonna help ourselves

00:49:27.102 --> 00:49:28.770
is to seek rescue

00:49:30.647 --> 00:49:31.648
We're going out

00:49:34.317 --> 00:49:36.361
- Brent, look
- I'm not discussing this any further

00:49:36.445 --> 00:49:38.613
I know I just want to ask a favor

00:49:40.323 --> 00:49:41.825
Tie this around your waist

00:49:41.908 --> 00:49:43.075
What for?

00:49:43.117 --> 00:49:45.244
It'll let us know you got
at least 300 feet

00:49:47.455 --> 00:49:48.456
I'll do it

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.500
Are you throwing in with them?

00:49:51.584 --> 00:49:53.669
Me? No thanks

00:49:53.753 --> 00:49:56.213
I think your man there
is a little too tightly wound

00:49:56.297 --> 00:49:58.507
Gonna get somebody killed

00:49:58.591 --> 00:50:01.385
But I'm thinkin' we could use
that shotgun of yours

00:50:01.969 --> 00:50:04.096
I saw where you parked
when I pulled in

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.348
Red pickup, right?
Far entrance?

00:50:06.432 --> 00:50:08.392
Son, you got brass balls

00:50:09.351 --> 00:50:11.186
The shells are
in the glove compartment

00:50:11.269 --> 00:50:12.228
Drive it back

00:50:14.689 --> 00:50:15.940
All right

00:50:16.024 --> 00:50:17.692
Just see they're paying out this line

00:50:17.776 --> 00:50:19.944
Line's up, I'll cut her loose,

00:50:20.028 --> 00:50:21.529
just so you understand

00:50:21.613 --> 00:50:22.572
Yeah

00:50:30.205 --> 00:50:32.540
You sure there's no way
I can talk you out of this?

00:50:32.624 --> 00:50:33.583
David

00:50:34.626 --> 00:50:37.878
there's nothing out there
Nothing in the mist

00:50:37.961 --> 00:50:39.922
What if you’re wrong?

00:50:41.006 --> 00:50:42.508
Then, I guess

00:50:44.551 --> 00:50:47.554
the joke would be on me after all

00:50:52.851 --> 00:50:54.103
We're gonna send back help

00:50:55.229 --> 00:50:57.564
You'll die out there
All of you

00:51:10.326 --> 00:51:13.496
Hey, crazy lady,
I believe in God too

00:51:13.579 --> 00:51:16.165
I just don't think
he's the bloodthirsty asshole

00:51:16.249 --> 00:51:17.583
you make him out to be

00:51:17.667 --> 00:51:20.378
Well, you take that up with the devil
when you run into him

00:51:20.461 --> 00:51:21.963
You just chat it over at your leisure

00:51:30.721 --> 00:51:32.639
Well, let's strike out
toward the center of town

00:51:51.783 --> 00:51:52.951
Keep it loose

00:52:08.924 --> 00:52:10.384
Nice and easy

00:52:10.468 --> 00:52:11.719
Keep going

00:52:29.402 --> 00:52:30.361
Look

00:52:33.573 --> 00:52:34.824
It's going

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:38.078
They're doing good

00:52:56.136 --> 00:52:57.346
Put it down!

00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:00.682
Pull!

00:53:02.559 --> 00:53:04.978
Oh, my God!
I'm slippin'!

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.816
Pull! Back up! Back up!
Back up!

00:53:22.246 --> 00:53:23.246
Get it off!

00:53:32.672 --> 00:53:33.631
Oh, my God

00:53:40.346 --> 00:53:41.806
Aw, sh...
Blood!

00:53:41.889 --> 00:53:43.641
Awww, sh...!

00:53:43.683 --> 00:53:45.351
Oh, my God!

00:53:46.519 --> 00:53:48.813
Oh, my God!

00:54:03.368 --> 00:54:04.661
Cut the rope!

00:54:07.414 --> 00:54:08.331
Shut the door!

00:54:14.171 --> 00:54:16.131
Now do you see?

00:54:18.175 --> 00:54:19.633
Now do you believe?

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:31.395
About a half-hour of day light left

00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:34.523
guys, how's it going
with these work lights?

00:54:34.565 --> 00:54:35.900
We're gettin' 'em rigged up all right

00:54:36.901 --> 00:54:38.235
Yeah, check it out

00:54:38.319 --> 00:54:40.821
All right, all right
Save it, save it

00:54:40.905 --> 00:54:42.698
These batteries ain't topped up

00:54:42.782 --> 00:54:44.909
You turn the lights on,
it's gonna drain 'em quick

00:54:44.992 --> 00:54:46.077
How quick?

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.161
- Five minutes, maybe ten
- Yeah, if that

00:54:48.244 --> 00:54:50.246
Okay, emergencies only

00:54:51.247 --> 00:54:52.749
If something gets in the store

00:55:00.465 --> 00:55:03.051
Holy Jesus,
you scared the shit outta me

00:55:03.134 --> 00:55:04.636
Oh, Sally, I'm sorry, really

00:55:06.221 --> 00:55:09.057
I thought I'd come in and say hi
and see how you were holding up

00:55:09.099 --> 00:55:10.600
- Hi
- Hi

00:55:11.726 --> 00:55:13.061
Barely How about you?

00:55:13.103 --> 00:55:14.686
I'm worried about my folks, I guess

00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:17.439
You know, they live
up on Shorm Road

00:55:17.523 --> 00:55:19.525
That's less than
five miles from here

00:55:19.608 --> 00:55:21.276
How 'bout yours?

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.861
Well, they're out of town right now

00:55:23.904 --> 00:55:26.490
They're at my aunt's in Boston, so

00:55:26.573 --> 00:55:29.326
That's lucky
That means they're okay

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:30.369
I hope so

00:55:32.913 --> 00:55:33.872
So

00:55:34.915 --> 00:55:36.500
how soon you shipping out?

00:55:36.583 --> 00:55:38.252
Uh, couple weeks

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.380
Scared about going over there?

00:55:42.797 --> 00:55:43.798
Yeah

00:55:49.095 --> 00:55:50.638
- Hey, Wayne?
- Hmm?

00:55:51.764 --> 00:55:53.224
How come you never asked me out?

00:55:54.308 --> 00:55:56.811
We flirted all through high school
I know you like me

00:56:01.023 --> 00:56:02.567
So how come?

00:56:05.027 --> 00:56:06.863
I'm stupid, I guess

00:56:23.378 --> 00:56:25.380
Oh, shit! I'm sorry

00:56:25.464 --> 00:56:26.673
Don't be I just...

00:56:27.674 --> 00:56:29.968
I just didn't really want it
to happen like this, you know?

00:56:30.051 --> 00:56:32.262
Some shitty locker room at work

00:56:33.263 --> 00:56:34.931
Can we just stay in here
a while, then?

00:56:36.391 --> 00:56:37.975
I mean, just... just you and me

00:56:50.071 --> 00:56:52.615
The parking lot lamps
turned on

00:56:52.656 --> 00:56:53.699
They're on a timer

00:56:53.783 --> 00:56:55.785
Must be a different one
that's live

00:56:55.868 --> 00:56:58.537
Maybe we could
tie into them somehow,

00:56:58.621 --> 00:57:00.498
get some electricity in here

00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:03.209
That'd mean walking out the door

00:57:14.219 --> 00:57:15.929
Gaaaahhhh! God!

00:57:16.805 --> 00:57:18.264
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

00:57:18.348 --> 00:57:20.308
David! David!

00:57:22.685 --> 00:57:23.686
You sure?

00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:24.771
Look!

00:57:47.876 --> 00:57:49.336
My God

00:58:04.892 --> 00:58:06.352
Are those bugs?

00:58:08.521 --> 00:58:09.772
Not like any I've ever seen

00:58:10.773 --> 00:58:12.942
"They came out of the smoke,

00:58:13.025 --> 00:58:14.944
"locusts upon the earth,

00:58:15.027 --> 00:58:17.530
"and unto them was given power

00:58:17.613 --> 00:58:21.784
even as the scorpions
of the earth have power"

00:58:21.868 --> 00:58:24.370
Wow

00:58:24.454 --> 00:58:26.914
Look at those stingers

00:58:30.375 --> 00:58:32.377
Dear God

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.042
Holy shit!

00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:30.433
Myron, get the ones in the back!

00:59:31.935 --> 00:59:33.645
God, I think they're
attracted to the light

00:59:33.728 --> 00:59:36.064
Look out, look out, look out!

00:59:36.147 --> 00:59:37.232
The light! Douse the light!

00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:40.235
Look out! Look out!

00:59:45.031 --> 00:59:46.324
Move! Move!

00:59:48.284 --> 00:59:50.786
Light, light,
light, light, light!

00:59:51.954 --> 00:59:53.789
"And there came a voice
from the temple

00:59:53.831 --> 00:59:55.666
"saying to the seven angels,

00:59:55.749 --> 00:59:58.085
"'Go your ways

00:59:58.168 --> 01:00:02.339
and pour out the vials
of the wrath of God upon the earth"'

01:00:11.223 --> 01:00:13.684
Ollie,
the glass is gonna give!

01:00:21.482 --> 01:00:22.483
Shit!

01:00:22.567 --> 01:00:24.026
Oh, my God,
they turned on all the lights!

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:26.279
Jim! Myron!
Fire!

01:00:26.362 --> 01:00:27.697
Fire! Lighter!
Douse the lights!

01:00:27.739 --> 01:00:30.032
Come on, come on!

01:00:41.544 --> 01:00:43.004
Sally, look out!

01:00:45.423 --> 01:00:46.423
No!

01:00:54.264 --> 01:00:56.808
Let me see, let me see
Let me see, sweetheart, let me see

01:00:56.892 --> 01:00:58.810
No, you’re gonna be okay
You're gonna be okay

01:00:58.894 --> 01:00:59.853
Let me see Let me see

01:00:59.936 --> 01:01:01.646
You're fine You're gonna be okay
You're gonna be okay

01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:03.065
Give me the lighter!
Put it on fire!

01:01:03.106 --> 01:01:04.107
Come on!

01:01:11.156 --> 01:01:13.283
Goddamn childproofing sons of bitches!

01:01:15.367 --> 01:01:17.620
Oh, shoot it! Shoot it!

01:01:19.246 --> 01:01:20.915
Shoot it! Shoot it!

01:01:20.998 --> 01:01:22.625
I can't! I'll smash the window!

01:01:22.708 --> 01:01:24.877
God!

01:01:24.919 --> 01:01:26.545
Oh, God! Ohh!

01:01:28.089 --> 01:01:29.799
Go! Go!

01:01:32.176 --> 01:01:34.011
Get down!

01:01:40.393 --> 01:01:41.851
Shit!

01:01:51.569 --> 01:01:52.946
Ollie, you want
these lights on or off?

01:01:52.946 --> 01:01:53.446
Leave 'em on

01:01:59.828 --> 01:02:00.912
Oh, God!

01:02:00.995 --> 01:02:03.289
Kill it!

01:02:12.423 --> 01:02:14.383
Bring torches!
Bring something to keep 'em out!

01:02:14.466 --> 01:02:15.426
Come on

01:02:17.386 --> 01:02:18.554
Sally!

01:02:30.441 --> 01:02:32.651
Where are the goddamn extinguishers?

01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:44.746
Get it! Get it! Get it!

01:02:50.126 --> 01:02:53.087
Bring torches
We need torches at the window!

01:02:53.171 --> 01:02:54.714
Plug that hole!

01:03:01.929 --> 01:03:02.930
Dad!

01:03:08.852 --> 01:03:10.520
Down! Down! Lay down!

01:03:24.743 --> 01:03:25.744
Ohh

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.121
My life

01:03:29.206 --> 01:03:32.666
my life for you,
your will be done

01:03:45.971 --> 01:03:48.140
Daddy!

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:50.476
Bugs! Daddy!

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:08.201
- Nooooo! Billy!
- Daddy!

01:04:08.284 --> 01:04:10.245
- Billy!
- Daddy!

01:04:23.258 --> 01:04:24.718
Billy!

01:04:24.801 --> 01:04:25.969
Dad!

01:04:26.052 --> 01:04:27.553
Billy, come back here

01:04:29.221 --> 01:04:31.223
- Dad!
- Billy, please!

01:04:37.104 --> 01:04:38.480
Billy!

01:05:07.383 --> 01:05:08.718
Come on, let's move it!

01:05:08.801 --> 01:05:10.762
Somebody please
come over here and help

01:05:10.845 --> 01:05:12.513
Here's some tape!

01:05:14.807 --> 01:05:16.934
I'm right here
I'm right here Don’t worry

01:05:18.019 --> 01:05:19.979
Hurry up with the blankets!

01:05:20.021 --> 01:05:23.023
It hurts so bad! Please!

01:05:30.864 --> 01:05:32.532
It hurts so bad!

01:05:32.616 --> 01:05:33.617
Block it up here

01:05:34.659 --> 01:05:36.453
Get me some more bags!

01:05:37.537 --> 01:05:40.207
Did we get 'em?
Did we get 'em all?

01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:42.918
She was right

01:05:43.001 --> 01:05:45.212
She said that
it would happen like this

01:05:45.379 --> 01:05:47.381
She said that
they would come at night

01:05:48.548 --> 01:05:50.383
She told us someone would die

01:06:14.407 --> 01:06:16.075
Mommy

01:06:17.701 --> 01:06:19.661
Ohh, shh, shh, shh
It's okay

01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:22.247
It's okay, it was just a dream

01:06:23.373 --> 01:06:24.708
It's just a bad dream

01:06:25.875 --> 01:06:27.627
I want my mommy

01:06:27.711 --> 01:06:29.295
I know

01:06:29.379 --> 01:06:31.631
I know Of course you do

01:06:31.715 --> 01:06:34.259
- Shh
I wanna go home

01:06:34.342 --> 01:06:35.844
Just sleep

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:38.888
Everything'll be better in the morning

01:06:45.561 --> 01:06:47.020
Think he likes you

01:06:49.606 --> 01:06:52.151
Well, I hate that
I had to lie to him

01:06:53.235 --> 01:06:54.695
You have kids?

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:55.988
No

01:06:56.071 --> 01:06:58.198
I always wanted to, but

01:06:59.324 --> 01:07:00.993
things haven't been working out

01:07:03.328 --> 01:07:06.290
Right now I'm thinking
maybe that's for the best

01:07:07.499 --> 01:07:11.253
I saw creatures
fly into the store tonight that...

01:07:11.336 --> 01:07:13.004
they shouldn't exist

01:07:14.505 --> 01:07:17.008
I keep thinking I'm gonna
wake up in a rubber room

01:07:18.509 --> 01:07:19.761
You're not alone in that

01:07:20.762 --> 01:07:22.221
We're all right there with you

01:07:23.347 --> 01:07:25.099
This isn't gonna end, is it?

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:29.145
David

01:07:30.229 --> 01:07:32.440
It's Joe He's getting worse

01:07:50.374 --> 01:07:52.292
Joe

01:07:54.211 --> 01:07:55.962
How you holdin' up, partner?

01:07:56.046 --> 01:07:59.383
David is that you?

01:08:00.467 --> 01:08:01.968
Yeah, pal, how you doin'?

01:08:02.969 --> 01:08:05.764
It's bad He's bad

01:08:05.806 --> 01:08:08.474
Didn't know anything
could hurt like this

01:08:09.475 --> 01:08:11.811
If you guys can't help me

01:08:12.978 --> 01:08:15.314
you... you gotta end it, okay?

01:08:17.483 --> 01:08:19.860
Ollie's got that gun, right?

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.864
Right?
- No. No way

01:08:23.948 --> 01:08:26.283
You can't fuck with me
on this, bro

01:08:26.325 --> 01:08:28.494
Not with me like this

01:08:28.577 --> 01:08:30.079
I'll do it

01:08:30.162 --> 01:08:32.915
Just give me the gun

01:08:32.998 --> 01:08:34.625
Hey, hey Shh

01:08:34.667 --> 01:08:37.794
- We're not there yet, okay?
- Oh, please!

01:08:37.836 --> 01:08:39.587
Joe, now, listen

01:08:40.672 --> 01:08:41.631
Pal

01:08:42.674 --> 01:08:43.842
we're gonna work something out

01:08:43.925 --> 01:08:45.635
I just need you to hang in
a little longer, okay?

01:08:45.677 --> 01:08:46.761
Can we do that?

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.308
Stay with him
I'll be back

01:08:55.687 --> 01:08:59.649
Hattie, I need to go to the bathroom
Will you watch Billy?

01:09:01.651 --> 01:09:02.652
Hattie

01:09:19.251 --> 01:09:20.252
See anything?

01:09:21.837 --> 01:09:24.631
The last of those bugs
went away about four

01:09:24.715 --> 01:09:25.674
Dawn's coming

01:09:26.717 --> 01:09:28.052
What's on your mind?

01:09:28.093 --> 01:09:29.094
It's Joe

01:09:31.013 --> 01:09:32.847
We don't get him
on some serious antibiotics,

01:09:32.889 --> 01:09:34.057
he's gonna die of infection

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.476
Plus he needs
painkillers in the worst way

01:09:36.559 --> 01:09:40.271
All... all... all we got here
is liquor and aspirin

01:09:40.355 --> 01:09:43.232
You... you thinkin' about goin'
to that pharmacy next door?

01:09:43.274 --> 01:09:45.234
Irene Reppler say
they've got Silvadene...

01:09:45.276 --> 01:09:46.986
you know, the stuff
they use in burn wards

01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:48.029
She knows where they keep it

01:09:48.112 --> 01:09:49.280
Slow down

01:09:49.364 --> 01:09:51.032
You can't actually be thinkin'
of doin' this

01:09:51.074 --> 01:09:52.992
I'm also thinkin' beyond that

01:09:53.076 --> 01:09:54.535
We have to get out of here

01:09:55.703 --> 01:09:56.913
I mean permanently.

01:09:56.954 --> 01:09:59.414
Why? We got plenty to eat!

01:09:59.498 --> 01:10:02.334
What happens when one of those things
decides to break through this window?

01:10:02.417 --> 01:10:05.003
I'm talkin' one of the big ones,
like the one that killed Norm

01:10:05.087 --> 01:10:08.048
Yeah, and that flaming torch idea
didn’t work so well, did it?

01:10:08.131 --> 01:10:10.258
We almost burned
the goddamn store down

01:10:16.556 --> 01:10:17.891
It's Hattie

01:10:24.606 --> 01:10:25.774
Here?

01:10:25.816 --> 01:10:27.817
All right,
gently, now Gently

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:30.152
One two three

01:10:39.745 --> 01:10:41.956
I don't know
how long she was there like that,

01:10:42.039 --> 01:10:43.374
lying there next to us

01:10:43.457 --> 01:10:45.126
I thought she was sleeping

01:10:46.502 --> 01:10:48.337
I got my 4-wheel drive

01:10:48.421 --> 01:10:50.005
It's out there

01:10:50.089 --> 01:10:51.757
Y- you’re talking about leaving?

01:10:53.092 --> 01:10:54.592
Well, we

01:10:54.634 --> 01:10:56.511
should hit the pharmacy first

01:10:56.594 --> 01:10:57.887
We gotta bring back
supplies for the injured

01:10:57.971 --> 01:10:59.389
I mean, if we don't,

01:10:59.472 --> 01:11:01.433
Joe Eagleton's gonna die,
and we can't let that happen

01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:03.518
But after that

01:11:04.519 --> 01:11:06.187
look, my Land Cruiser
can hold eight people

01:11:06.271 --> 01:11:08.481
I say we drive south
as far as the fuel takes us

01:11:08.565 --> 01:11:09.899
and try to get clear of this mist

01:11:10.859 --> 01:11:12.861
That's it?

01:11:12.944 --> 01:11:14.279
That's the plan?

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.239
- That's what I got
- No, you can't mean it

01:11:16.322 --> 01:11:18.283
Not after what happened
to Norton and his group

01:11:18.366 --> 01:11:20.827
No, no, no Amanda, think.

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:22.911
Norton got over 200 feet
from this store

01:11:22.995 --> 01:11:24.455
That's how much rope play ed out

01:11:24.538 --> 01:11:27.082
I'm parked half that distance
from here

01:11:27.166 --> 01:11:29.126
But who knows how far
this mist has spread?

01:11:29.209 --> 01:11:30.711
It could be
the entire eastern seaboard

01:11:30.794 --> 01:11:32.963
Yeah, it could be the whole world,
for all we know

01:11:33.005 --> 01:11:36.341
Wouldn't make us any less dead,
now, would it?

01:11:36.383 --> 01:11:38.218
We have one gun

01:11:38.302 --> 01:11:40.304
- How many rounds?
We got ten left

01:11:40.345 --> 01:11:41.513
Ten rounds Jesus

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:43.223
Okay, so ten

01:11:44.224 --> 01:11:46.226
Want another reason
to get the hell out of here?

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:48.312
I'll give you the best one

01:11:48.395 --> 01:11:49.396
Her

01:11:50.396 --> 01:11:51.898
Mrs Carmody

01:11:51.981 --> 01:11:54.859
She's our very own Jim Jones

01:11:54.901 --> 01:11:57.570
I'd like to leave before people
start drinking the Kool-Aid

01:11:57.653 --> 01:11:58.654
He's right

01:11:58.696 --> 01:12:01.032
Flakier people get,
the better she's gonna look

01:12:01.115 --> 01:12:03.785
No, I don't buy that
It's obvious she's nuts

01:12:03.868 --> 01:12:05.328
Look, a few people maybe, but...

01:12:05.411 --> 01:12:07.705
No, I count four
She's preachin' to 'em right now

01:12:07.789 --> 01:12:09.290
By noon, she'll have four more

01:12:09.374 --> 01:12:11.501
By tomorrow night,
when those things come back,

01:12:11.584 --> 01:12:13.086
she'll have a congregation,

01:12:13.169 --> 01:12:16.672
and then we can start worryin'
about who she's gonna sacrifice

01:12:16.714 --> 01:12:18.382
to make it all better

01:12:18.465 --> 01:12:20.133
Hmm?

01:12:20.217 --> 01:12:22.135
You, Amanda?

01:12:22.219 --> 01:12:23.470
My little boy?

01:12:23.553 --> 01:12:25.138
He's right

01:12:25.222 --> 01:12:27.349
You don't have much faith
in humanity, do you?

01:12:28.392 --> 01:12:29.768
None whatsoever

01:12:29.851 --> 01:12:31.353
I can't accept that

01:12:31.395 --> 01:12:34.106
People are
basically good, decent

01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:36.400
My God, David,
we're a civilized society

01:12:36.483 --> 01:12:37.984
Sure, as long as
the machines are workin'

01:12:38.068 --> 01:12:39.319
And you can dial 9-1-1,

01:12:39.403 --> 01:12:42.239
but you take those things away,
you throw people in the dark,

01:12:42.322 --> 01:12:44.324
you scare the shit out of them,

01:12:44.408 --> 01:12:46.242
no more rules,

01:12:46.283 --> 01:12:48.285
You’ll see how primitive they get

01:12:48.369 --> 01:12:51.080
You scare people badly enough,

01:12:51.122 --> 01:12:53.624
you can get 'em to do anything

01:12:53.708 --> 01:12:57.378
They'll turn to whoever
promises a solution,

01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:58.587
or whatever.

01:12:58.671 --> 01:13:00.673
Ollie, please, back me up here

01:13:00.756 --> 01:13:02.425
I wish I could

01:13:02.508 --> 01:13:04.844
As a species,
we're fundamentally insane

01:13:05.845 --> 01:13:07.888
Put more than two of us
in a room, we pick sides

01:13:07.972 --> 01:13:10.558
and start dreaming up reasons
to kill one another

01:13:11.559 --> 01:13:14.227
Why do you think we invented
politics and religion?

01:13:14.269 --> 01:13:16.896
Oh, Jesus, that's just

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:17.981
wrong

01:13:18.064 --> 01:13:20.608
Look, nobody has
to decide anything now, okay?

01:13:20.692 --> 01:13:22.193
First things first...

01:13:22.777 --> 01:13:23.737
the pharmacy

01:13:25.363 --> 01:13:27.032
That'll be our test run

01:13:27.115 --> 01:13:28.074
Okay?

01:13:38.334 --> 01:13:40.127
It's all right, Big Bill

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:41.879
I'm gonna bring you back
some comic books

01:13:41.962 --> 01:13:43.297
I don’t want them

01:13:43.338 --> 01:13:45.007
I want you to stay here

01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:47.092
I won't be gone long

01:13:48.218 --> 01:13:50.137
Just... just next door

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.056
Hey, you’ll be safe

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.641
Daddy...

01:13:54.725 --> 01:13:56.226
Daddy, there are things out there

01:13:57.227 --> 01:13:59.146
Things...

01:13:59.188 --> 01:14:02.107
Yeah There's a lot
less of 'em in the daytime

01:14:03.650 --> 01:14:04.693
They'll wait

01:14:04.777 --> 01:14:06.445
They'll wait in the mist
where you can't see 'em,

01:14:06.487 --> 01:14:08.946
and then when you go
and can't get back in

01:14:08.988 --> 01:14:10.490
they'll come and eat you up!

01:14:10.573 --> 01:14:12.825
- Shh
- Daddy, don't go!

01:14:22.168 --> 01:14:23.336
I'll be back

01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:25.963
Big Bill

01:14:26.005 --> 01:14:27.298
I promise

01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:29.675
I'll be back, and then
I'm gonna take you home

01:14:30.677 --> 01:14:32.303
All right?

01:14:32.345 --> 01:14:34.430
Together, we're going home

01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:37.474
If something happens,
anything at all,

01:14:37.557 --> 01:14:38.725
you cut and run

01:14:38.809 --> 01:14:41.436
You get your ass back in here,
for your boy's sake

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.980
If something happens to me,
I want you to take care of Billy

01:14:45.023 --> 01:14:48.026
best as you can,
and long as you can

01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:49.861
Land Cruiser's yours now

01:14:50.946 --> 01:14:52.489
You... you get him out of here

01:14:52.572 --> 01:14:53.907
You just keep drivin'

01:15:00.497 --> 01:15:02.499
Where do you think you’re going,
Mr David Drayton on?

01:15:02.541 --> 01:15:05.584
Are you so anxious
to make your boy an orphan?

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:07.753
My boy is no concern of yours

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:09.088
Listen up

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:11.173
We're going to the pharmacy

01:15:11.215 --> 01:15:13.217
We're gonna bring back
some supplies

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:16.679
Also, there maybe people
trapped over there who need help

01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:18.889
Listen, folks, listen!

01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:20.975
We're not gonna take any chances

01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:22.518
If there's any trouble,

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:24.603
we'll come straight back here
to the supermarket

01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:28.024
And bring the fiends of hell
down on our heads, thank you

01:15:28.065 --> 01:15:29.567
She's right

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:31.317
You'll make 'em notice us

01:15:31.401 --> 01:15:32.652
You'll make 'em come

01:15:33.653 --> 01:15:36.364
Why can't you just leave
well enough alone?

01:15:36.406 --> 01:15:38.283
Lady, this what you call
'"well enough"?

01:15:38.366 --> 01:15:39.868
You wanna stop us?

01:15:39.909 --> 01:15:41.411
You better explain to Bobby here

01:15:41.494 --> 01:15:43.747
why we're not bringin' painkillers
and medicine back for his brother

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:45.999
I'm goin', even if I have to go alone

01:15:46.082 --> 01:15:47.792
You'll die out there, young man

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:50.920
You'll walk out that door
and be torn to shreds,

01:15:51.004 --> 01:15:54.174
and then your hell-bound pride
will have them come get the rest of us

01:15:54.257 --> 01:15:57.093
Yes, they'll come back for all of us,
just like this good lady said

01:15:57.177 --> 01:15:59.178
Do you want that
to happen, people?

01:15:59.261 --> 01:16:02.431
No!
No! No! No!

01:16:02.514 --> 01:16:04.516
Well, it is this kind of hubris

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.019
that brought the wrath of God
in the first place

01:16:07.102 --> 01:16:08.771
This kind of pride and defiance of...

01:16:10.564 --> 01:16:12.274
Shut up, you miserable buzzard!

01:16:12.316 --> 01:16:14.193
You old bitch!

01:16:17.738 --> 01:16:20.824
Stoning people who piss you off
is perfectly okay

01:16:20.908 --> 01:16:22.576
They do it in the Bible, don't they?

01:16:22.618 --> 01:16:24.453
And I got lots of peas

01:16:24.536 --> 01:16:27.121
David, please, if you want to go,
now's the time

01:16:27.205 --> 01:16:28.956
How 'bout it, Army?

01:16:28.998 --> 01:16:30.500
Any help from the armed forces?

01:16:30.583 --> 01:16:31.584
I'll go

01:16:34.003 --> 01:16:35.505
Jim Grondin

01:16:35.588 --> 01:16:37.090
I had you in school, didn't I?

01:16:37.131 --> 01:16:39.133
Yes, me and my sister Pauline

01:16:39.175 --> 01:16:40.843
Pair of underachievers

01:16:40.927 --> 01:16:42.136
After you, Jim

01:16:43.221 --> 01:16:44.639
Yes, ma'am

01:16:44.681 --> 01:16:46.015
Oh, shit.

01:16:46.099 --> 01:16:48.476
That it?
That's every body?

01:16:48.559 --> 01:16:50.061
Every body that's goin'

01:16:50.144 --> 01:16:52.146
Yep
- Okay

01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:55.273
Single file,
one by one, all right?

01:16:55.357 --> 01:16:57.109
Let's get this thing over with

01:16:58.235 --> 01:16:59.236
Let's go

01:16:59.319 --> 01:17:01.154
After you
Yes

01:17:04.157 --> 01:17:05.158
Stay together

01:17:08.286 --> 01:17:10.163
You know what?

01:17:10.247 --> 01:17:11.748
Mrs Carmody, you’re not helping

01:17:11.832 --> 01:17:13.500
Shut the hell up!
- You shut up!

01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:21.674
Save the batteries

01:18:09.137 --> 01:18:10.722
Shit.

01:18:10.805 --> 01:18:12.807
They left the doors propped open

01:18:14.142 --> 01:18:15.685
Think something got in?

01:18:17.186 --> 01:18:20.189
Let's just
get what we need,

01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:21.648
get the hell outta here

01:18:21.732 --> 01:18:23.192
Yeah Let's do that

01:18:23.275 --> 01:18:26.111
The meds
are over at the end there,

01:18:26.195 --> 01:18:27.696
in the cubicle

01:18:48.174 --> 01:18:49.509
Will you not do that?

01:18:49.592 --> 01:18:51.552
I'm sorry I'm sorry.

01:18:51.636 --> 01:18:53.596
Oh, God.

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:19.621
Where's that Silvadene?

01:19:19.705 --> 01:19:21.206
It's over behind David

01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:23.125
In the fridge Check there

01:19:29.256 --> 01:19:30.674
Silvadene Got it

01:19:31.258 --> 01:19:33.301
- Good
- Ollie, what are we lookin' for?

01:19:33.385 --> 01:19:34.886
Penicillin
Yeah

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:36.430
Any strong antibiotics

01:19:36.513 --> 01:19:37.514
Yeah

01:19:38.265 --> 01:19:41.684
Pain meds like
Vicodin or OxyContin

01:19:41.767 --> 01:19:43.269
Shh!
- OxyContin!

01:19:44.979 --> 01:19:46.772
Hydrochloride?

01:19:49.275 --> 01:19:50.276
Penicillin

01:20:01.537 --> 01:20:02.538
guys

01:20:06.417 --> 01:20:08.043
Hurry it up
I hear something

01:20:11.921 --> 01:20:12.922
What?

01:20:15.175 --> 01:20:16.760
Somethin' fuckin' weird

01:20:26.353 --> 01:20:28.146
Oh, God

01:20:28.355 --> 01:20:29.647
Oh, God!

01:20:29.689 --> 01:20:33.651
No Oh, no

01:20:33.735 --> 01:20:35.486
Oh, nooooo

01:20:35.569 --> 01:20:37.112
Oh, fuck.

01:20:39.031 --> 01:20:40.991
Look

01:20:41.033 --> 01:20:43.827
Oh, my God

01:20:43.869 --> 01:20:46.246
Oh, no, no

01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:50.000
guys, let's get out of here now.

01:20:51.043 --> 01:20:52.920
Holy shit!

01:20:56.882 --> 01:20:59.551
Shit! Shit! Oh, shit!

01:20:59.635 --> 01:21:04.013
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Help me!

01:21:04.055 --> 01:21:06.140
Good Lord!
Help him!

01:21:11.979 --> 01:21:13.439
Son of a bitch!

01:21:13.523 --> 01:21:15.108
This stuff ain't comin' off!

01:21:16.109 --> 01:21:18.528
Oh, man!
He's glued to this fuckin' post!

01:21:18.569 --> 01:21:20.405
It's our fault

01:21:20.488 --> 01:21:22.532
It's all our fault

01:21:22.615 --> 01:21:24.075
It's really stuck

01:21:28.413 --> 01:21:30.414
God, I can feel 'em!

01:21:30.497 --> 01:21:32.499
I can feel 'em!

01:21:34.167 --> 01:21:36.086
Oh, my God!
Jesus!

01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:44.845
Oh, my God

01:21:44.928 --> 01:21:47.389
I...

01:21:56.732 --> 01:21:58.691
There's more!

01:22:08.701 --> 01:22:09.910
There's another one!
Hit it!

01:22:11.829 --> 01:22:14.123
What the hell is that stuff?

01:22:14.206 --> 01:22:16.083
Ollie! One over there!

01:22:16.125 --> 01:22:17.710
Ollie, there!

01:22:17.793 --> 01:22:19.503
Got it!

There, there, there!

Help me!

01:22:45.195 --> 01:22:46.946
Let's get out of here!

01:22:48.948 --> 01:22:51.284
- A belt! Who's got a belt?
- I got a belt!

01:22:56.163 --> 01:22:57.498
I got him, I got him
Hold on

01:22:58.832 --> 01:23:00.292
Pull it tight!

01:23:01.835 --> 01:23:03.462
Look! Look!

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:13.931
Light!

01:23:14.014 --> 01:23:16.517
God!

01:23:19.645 --> 01:23:22.814
We gotta get outta here!
Come on!

01:23:22.855 --> 01:23:25.316
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:27.360
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

01:23:38.663 --> 01:23:40.081
Let's get out of here!

01:23:41.082 --> 01:23:44.168
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Come on!

01:23:44.252 --> 01:23:45.420
Come on!

01:23:52.634 --> 01:23:54.636
Oh, my God!

01:23:56.346 --> 01:23:58.015
Ollie! Ollie!

01:24:02.477 --> 01:24:04.354
Kill it! Kill it!

01:24:15.073 --> 01:24:16.074
Fuckers!

01:24:16.198 --> 01:24:17.241
Oh, no! Oh, God, he's dead!

01:24:17.325 --> 01:24:19.994
He's dead! Get out of here!
Let's go, let's go!

01:24:20.077 --> 01:24:21.871
Drayton on, come on,
come on, come on!

01:24:21.954 --> 01:24:23.456
Come on, Drayton on,
he's dead!

01:24:23.539 --> 01:24:24.498
Come on!

01:24:55.737 --> 01:24:57.072
Open the door!

01:24:58.698 --> 01:24:59.908
Where's Bobby?

01:24:59.949 --> 01:25:00.950
Daddy!

01:25:02.452 --> 01:25:03.453
Close up the doors!

01:25:03.578 --> 01:25:04.537
Hurry up!

01:25:04.621 --> 01:25:06.206
What happened?

01:25:06.247 --> 01:25:09.000
They're dead!
They're all dead!

01:25:25.974 --> 01:25:27.935
Expiation, because we have seen

01:25:28.018 --> 01:25:30.562
the earth scourged
with whips and scorpions

01:25:30.646 --> 01:25:34.650
We have seen the earth
vomit forth from her lips

01:25:34.733 --> 01:25:36.735
obscenities and profanities

01:25:36.819 --> 01:25:39.112
of such nightmare proportions

01:25:39.195 --> 01:25:43.032
And for these evil,
lurking spirits,

01:25:43.116 --> 01:25:45.076
and for these evil people

01:25:45.159 --> 01:25:46.494
How long was I out?

01:25:46.577 --> 01:25:47.954
Most of the day

01:25:49.038 --> 01:25:51.541
You just came over here to lay down
and went to sleep

01:25:51.624 --> 01:25:53.292
Just passed out, is more like it

01:25:53.334 --> 01:25:54.794
What will stop this Great Whore?

01:25:54.877 --> 01:25:56.963
Just shut down for a while

01:25:57.046 --> 01:25:58.047
Sorry

01:25:58.131 --> 01:25:59.465
How will it end?

01:25:59.549 --> 01:26:00.550
Expiation!

01:26:00.633 --> 01:26:03.261
Expiation!
Do you remember yesterday when

01:26:03.302 --> 01:26:05.013
How's Joe?

01:26:05.096 --> 01:26:08.473
Dead Joe died of his burns
while you were asleep

01:26:09.057 --> 01:26:10.892
We were just too late

01:26:10.976 --> 01:26:12.310
I told you this would come!

01:26:12.352 --> 01:26:14.771
Oh, God,
I thought I was dreaming her voice

01:26:14.855 --> 01:26:16.148
No dream

01:26:16.231 --> 01:26:18.442
She's getting people whipped up

01:26:18.483 --> 01:26:21.278
That poor girl is dead,

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.697
and that boy is burnt in the back room!

01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:25.949
She's got 'em believing
she's a psychic,

01:26:26.033 --> 01:26:27.659
she has a direct line with God

01:26:27.743 --> 01:26:30.245
Why wouldn't they?
Woman never shuts up

01:26:30.329 --> 01:26:32.622
Like those speeches
Castro used to make

01:26:35.333 --> 01:26:38.669
Ollie say you’re thinking of leaving

01:26:38.711 --> 01:26:40.046
I'm in

01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:42.089
No Sorry

01:26:42.173 --> 01:26:46.010
I mean, come on, you saw what
happened to Bobby Mike

01:26:46.052 --> 01:26:47.053
I won't

01:26:47.136 --> 01:26:49.847
do that again
I won't be responsible

01:26:49.889 --> 01:26:51.349
You might want to reconsider that

01:26:51.432 --> 01:26:53.601
What will... what will keep these evil,

01:26:53.684 --> 01:26:54.852
these abominations at bay?

01:26:54.894 --> 01:26:56.395
What will keep them away?

01:26:56.479 --> 01:26:59.482
"The rock will not hide them
The dead tree gives no shelter"

01:26:59.523 --> 01:27:00.941
What will end it?
Let me hear it

01:27:01.025 --> 01:27:02.901
- Expiation!
- What are we talking about?

01:27:03.068 --> 01:27:05.570
- Expiation!
- Say it again like you mean it!

01:27:05.654 --> 01:27:06.946
Expiation!

01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:11.993
Welcome to Sesame Street
Today's word is "expiation"

01:27:12.077 --> 01:27:14.120
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

01:27:14.204 --> 01:27:16.873
That boy hasn't been right
since the pharmacy

01:27:16.915 --> 01:27:19.918
His mind's just snapped
Gone

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:21.503
Hasn't even been two day s

01:27:22.587 --> 01:27:24.089
Not even two day s

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:26.758
I'm not spendin' the rest
of my life here, I'll tell you what

01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:29.511
I can quietly gather up
some bags of groceries

01:27:29.552 --> 01:27:32.888
and hide them up at one of
the check stands by the door

01:27:32.971 --> 01:27:35.224
It was your idea
It's your vehicle

01:27:35.307 --> 01:27:36.809
It'll be your call

01:27:38.769 --> 01:27:41.313
I'd rather die out there trying
than in here waiting

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.734
Who will save them? No one

01:27:45.776 --> 01:27:48.862
The rocks will not hide them

01:27:48.946 --> 01:27:51.740
I want some idea
of what we’re up against

01:27:51.782 --> 01:27:53.450
I want to know what this mist is

01:27:54.785 --> 01:27:55.953
I want to talk to the soldiers

01:27:56.036 --> 01:27:57.537
Soldiers? What's that gonna do?

01:27:57.578 --> 01:27:59.831
You heard what that MP said
at the pharmacy

01:27:59.914 --> 01:28:02.250
David, I'm not even sure
I knew he was talking

01:28:02.291 --> 01:28:03.960
The situation was insane

01:28:04.043 --> 01:28:05.837
He said he was sorry

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.880
Wasn't that the word
he used... "sorry"?

01:28:07.964 --> 01:28:09.966
That's right
He said it was their fault, right?

01:28:10.049 --> 01:28:11.592
What did he mean by that?

01:28:11.676 --> 01:28:14.178
That's what we’re gonna find out

01:28:14.262 --> 01:28:15.930
Irene, stay with Billy, please

01:28:15.972 --> 01:28:17.265
Verse 17!

01:28:17.348 --> 01:28:19.851
"poured out his vial into the air,

01:28:19.934 --> 01:28:21.811
"and there came a great voice

01:28:21.894 --> 01:28:24.605
"out of the temple of heaven
from the throne, saying,

01:28:24.689 --> 01:28:27.190
"'It is done! It is done! '

01:28:27.274 --> 01:28:30.485
"And there were voices
and lightning,

01:28:30.569 --> 01:28:33.613
and thunders,
and a great earthquake"

01:28:33.697 --> 01:28:36.366
Yes! Come to me!

01:28:36.450 --> 01:28:37.617
What?

01:28:37.659 --> 01:28:39.911
- Where's your friends?
- I ain't seen 'em

01:28:39.995 --> 01:28:42.247
Not that big a store
It's kinda hard to lose

01:28:42.331 --> 01:28:45.292
I ain't seen 'em, I said
I look like their keeper?

01:28:48.462 --> 01:28:51.423
- What do you want from me?
- What do you know about this mist?

01:28:51.506 --> 01:28:53.966
I don't know nothin'
I got nothin' to do with it

01:28:54.008 --> 01:28:55.801
That's not what the MP
said in the pharmacy

01:28:55.843 --> 01:28:57.678
before the spiders
came out of his skin

01:28:59.221 --> 01:29:00.973
They're not in the store

01:29:01.057 --> 01:29:04.226
The only place we haven't looked
is the loading dock

01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:05.269
because you know

01:29:05.353 --> 01:29:07.521
You saw the good face
of God tonight

01:29:07.605 --> 01:29:08.856
Yes? Tell us

01:29:08.939 --> 01:29:11.150
Here is an old man
who has seen!

01:29:11.233 --> 01:29:13.402
Yes, he has seen!

01:29:13.486 --> 01:29:14.445
Amen

01:29:14.528 --> 01:29:16.030
And I want to say,

01:29:16.113 --> 01:29:18.240
do I want to walk with you

01:29:18.324 --> 01:29:20.992
into my Father's hands?

01:29:21.534 --> 01:29:22.535
Morales

01:29:23.578 --> 01:29:24.579
Donaldson

01:29:27.248 --> 01:29:28.249
guys

01:29:30.585 --> 01:29:32.087
It's the only place they can be

01:29:33.088 --> 01:29:34.130
What?

01:29:34.214 --> 01:29:35.632
Couldn’t just disappear

01:29:35.674 --> 01:29:38.677
Look, I told you,
okay, I don't know where they are...

01:29:45.767 --> 01:29:47.268
I didn't think they'd do it

01:29:47.352 --> 01:29:49.895
They said they would do it,
and I just...

01:29:49.979 --> 01:29:52.147
I told them what
the MP said at the pharmacy,

01:29:52.231 --> 01:29:53.357
and they swore they'd do it

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.109
I just... I didn't think they would

01:29:55.192 --> 01:29:56.151
Jesus

01:29:56.235 --> 01:29:59.446
It's the Arrowhead Project,
isn't it?

01:29:59.530 --> 01:30:03.117
This mist, it's some kind of, what,
military fuckup?

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:04.660
What were you guys
messin' with up there, huh?

01:30:04.743 --> 01:30:07.621
We got you now,
you sorry son of a bitch!

01:30:07.705 --> 01:30:08.664
Get in there!

01:30:08.747 --> 01:30:11.750
It was them!
It was them what done it to us!

01:30:11.834 --> 01:30:15.337
It was them what brung down
the final wrath upon us!

01:30:15.421 --> 01:30:17.880
Those two peckerwoods that
he's been with this whole time,

01:30:17.964 --> 01:30:20.383
they hung themselves in the back
because they knew!

01:30:20.425 --> 01:30:21.926
They knew it all along!

01:30:22.010 --> 01:30:23.845
- He's crazy He doesn't know...
- Get on your knees!

01:30:23.886 --> 01:30:25.221
Stay out of it, Drayton on!

01:30:25.305 --> 01:30:27.307
They heard it too, didn't you?
All of ya!

01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:28.725
All about the Arrowhead Project

01:30:28.808 --> 01:30:30.852
and all that secret shit
up on the mountain

01:30:30.935 --> 01:30:32.395
That's what brung it down on us

01:30:32.478 --> 01:30:34.605
That's what brung down
the wrath of God!

01:30:34.689 --> 01:30:35.690
Oh!

01:30:37.483 --> 01:30:39.402
Private Jessup

01:30:41.321 --> 01:30:42.488
It wasn't me.

01:30:42.572 --> 01:30:44.906
I'm just...
I'm stationed up there

01:30:44.948 --> 01:30:46.366
I'm not responsible...

01:30:46.450 --> 01:30:48.076
- Bullshit!
- Hell, I'm a local!

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:50.162
Most of you people know me

01:30:50.245 --> 01:30:52.706
You stop your chicken shit whining

01:30:52.789 --> 01:30:55.417
or I will cut your puling tongue out

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:57.044
Now you tell us!

01:30:59.087 --> 01:31:00.255
Tell us

01:31:00.339 --> 01:31:03.008
Look, look Okay, okay

01:31:03.091 --> 01:31:04.509
I heard stuff

01:31:04.593 --> 01:31:05.886
Stuff?

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:07.929
Yes, we all heard stuff

01:31:09.306 --> 01:31:13.059
Like how they, um,

01:31:13.142 --> 01:31:15.227
how they thought
that there were other dimensions,

01:31:15.311 --> 01:31:18.105
you know, other...
other worlds all around us,

01:31:18.189 --> 01:31:20.691
and how they wanted
to try and make, um,

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:22.234
a window...

01:31:22.318 --> 01:31:24.904
you know, so they could look through
and see what's on the other side

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:29.867
Well, maybe your window
turned out to be a door Didn't it?

01:31:29.950 --> 01:31:31.786
Not mine! Those scientists'!

01:31:31.869 --> 01:31:34.413
Oh, the scientists!
Yes, the scientists!

01:31:34.497 --> 01:31:36.624
They must have ripped
a hole open by accident

01:31:36.666 --> 01:31:38.459
This other world
came spilling through to ours

01:31:38.542 --> 01:31:41.878
That's what Donaldson was saying
to me right before he killed himself

01:31:41.961 --> 01:31:43.922
I didn't understand the half of it

01:31:45.882 --> 01:31:47.425
It ain't my fault!

01:31:47.509 --> 01:31:48.551
Oh

01:31:49.636 --> 01:31:52.973
Ain't His Fault

01:31:53.056 --> 01:31:55.600
No, no, no

01:31:55.642 --> 01:31:57.018
Ain't nothin'

01:31:57.102 --> 01:31:59.688
Ever anybody's fault

01:31:59.771 --> 01:32:02.107
But he denies it

01:32:02.148 --> 01:32:04.651
He points the finger,

01:32:04.734 --> 01:32:07.820
this Judas in our midst

01:32:07.903 --> 01:32:08.904
Judas!

01:32:08.988 --> 01:32:10.823
David!

01:32:10.906 --> 01:32:13.158
You! You!

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.160
Don't you know by now?

01:32:15.202 --> 01:32:17.287
Don't you know the truth?

01:32:17.371 --> 01:32:19.957
We are being punished

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:23.627
For what? For going
against the will of God!

01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:27.965
For going against
his forbidden rules of old!

01:32:28.007 --> 01:32:29.508
Walking on the moon!

01:32:29.591 --> 01:32:31.093
Yes! Yes!

01:32:31.176 --> 01:32:34.053
- Or... or splitting his atoms!
Amen!

01:32:34.137 --> 01:32:36.514
Or... or... or stem cells

01:32:36.597 --> 01:32:38.850
and abortions!

01:32:38.933 --> 01:32:41.894
And destroying the secrets of life

01:32:41.978 --> 01:32:45.231
that only God above has any right to!

01:32:45.315 --> 01:32:46.816
Amen! Amen!

01:32:46.858 --> 01:32:49.444
Yes, I know! It is true!

01:32:49.527 --> 01:32:51.988
And now we are being punished

01:32:52.071 --> 01:32:55.074
The judgment is being
brought down upon us

01:32:55.158 --> 01:32:57.827
The fiends of hell,
you see they are let loose,

01:32:57.869 --> 01:33:01.497
and star Wormwood blazes!

01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:02.873
And it is his fault!

01:33:02.956 --> 01:33:06.293
No! No! It is not my fault! No!

01:33:06.376 --> 01:33:09.338
They did it! They spit
in the eye of the Almighty!

01:33:09.421 --> 01:33:10.422
No!

01:33:10.505 --> 01:33:12.716
Get over there!

01:33:13.258 --> 01:33:14.343
No!

01:33:14.426 --> 01:33:16.053
Judas!

01:33:17.387 --> 01:33:18.347
Jim!

01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:20.891
Kill him! String him up!

01:33:23.977 --> 01:33:25.646
Stand up, you coward!

01:33:30.232 --> 01:33:31.359
Jesus!

01:33:34.362 --> 01:33:35.571
No!

01:33:37.114 --> 01:33:39.283
Expiation!

01:33:39.867 --> 01:33:40.951
- No!
Stab him!

01:33:42.536 --> 01:33:44.455
Expiation!

01:33:44.538 --> 01:33:47.249
Feed him to the beast!

01:33:47.333 --> 01:33:49.251
Expiation!

01:33:49.335 --> 01:33:53.297
Let the abominations
smell his blood!

01:33:54.799 --> 01:33:56.467
No, no! No!

01:33:59.219 --> 01:34:02.430
- Jesus! Wait!
- No, David!

01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:00.611
Please

01:35:11.247 --> 01:35:13.916
The beast will leave us alone tonight

01:35:15.418 --> 01:35:16.419
Tomorrow

01:35:17.754 --> 01:35:20.255
tomorrow, we'll just
have to wait and see

01:35:29.598 --> 01:35:30.766
Daddy

01:35:32.434 --> 01:35:33.602
Daddy

01:35:45.447 --> 01:35:47.282
Sorry I left you, pal

01:35:49.617 --> 01:35:51.285
I'll never leave you again

01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:53.788
Promise?

01:35:55.206 --> 01:35:58.876
But you have to give me
your best promise, okay?

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:02.380
Your very best promise,
and can never break it

01:36:02.463 --> 01:36:04.215
Tell me

01:36:05.883 --> 01:36:08.219
Promise you won't let
the monsters get me

01:36:11.889 --> 01:36:14.058
Ever No matter what

01:36:15.767 --> 01:36:17.227
I promise

01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.273
I love you, Daddy

01:36:22.857 --> 01:36:24.234
I love you, Billy

01:36:25.235 --> 01:36:26.569
More than anything

01:36:56.265 --> 01:36:57.433
It's dawn

01:37:02.896 --> 01:37:05.733
Hey, pal,
you ready to go home?

01:37:05.774 --> 01:37:07.151
Come on

01:37:09.570 --> 01:37:12.572
Okay, I got the groceries
hidden at check stand number two

01:37:12.613 --> 01:37:15.116
Five bags We can grab 'em
and get out the door

01:37:15.199 --> 01:37:16.492
Okay

01:37:16.576 --> 01:37:20.288
My car's parked in the center lane
of the parking lot, far end

01:37:20.371 --> 01:37:22.707
Whoever gets there first,
open up both doors,

01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:25.293
and we'll all pile in
as fast as we can, okay?

01:37:25.376 --> 01:37:26.544
Let's go

01:37:49.941 --> 01:37:52.152
Stealing food now?

01:37:56.406 --> 01:37:58.408
Going out now, Mrs Carmody

01:37:59.701 --> 01:38:01.370
Please stand aside

01:38:02.788 --> 01:38:05.332
You can't go out
I won't allow it

01:38:05.415 --> 01:38:06.749
Won't allow it?

01:38:06.832 --> 01:38:09.502
It's against God's will

01:38:09.543 --> 01:38:11.671
Don't you know that by now?

01:38:11.754 --> 01:38:16.300
Haven't I proven my self
again and again and again?

01:38:16.384 --> 01:38:20.846
Haven't I shown that I am his vessel?

01:38:25.726 --> 01:38:27.228
What's the matter with you?

01:38:30.564 --> 01:38:32.024
Don't you believe in God?

01:38:33.025 --> 01:38:34.567
No one's interfered with you

01:38:34.651 --> 01:38:37.237
All we're asking for
is the same privilege

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:38.655
You heard him

01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:44.244
It is these people
who brought this upon us

01:38:45.537 --> 01:38:46.496
They...

01:38:46.579 --> 01:38:50.542
people who refused to bend
to the will of God,

01:38:50.583 --> 01:38:53.169
and claim it privilege

01:38:53.253 --> 01:38:56.256
Sinners in pride

01:38:56.339 --> 01:38:58.341
Yes, haughty

01:38:58.383 --> 01:39:00.010
Privileged!

01:39:00.552 --> 01:39:04.388
They mock us They mock our...
our God, our faith,

01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:07.891
our values, our very lifestyle

01:39:07.933 --> 01:39:10.102
They mock our humility

01:39:10.185 --> 01:39:12.021
and our piousness

01:39:12.062 --> 01:39:15.232
They piss on us and laugh

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:20.154
It's from them

01:39:20.237 --> 01:39:23.741
the blood of human sacrifice
must come

01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:25.784
From them

01:39:25.868 --> 01:39:28.454
- Come on
- the blood of expiation

01:39:28.537 --> 01:39:29.537
Come on

01:39:29.579 --> 01:39:31.164
You try it

01:39:31.247 --> 01:39:32.582
Fuckin' try it!

01:39:32.624 --> 01:39:34.083
Come on!

01:39:34.167 --> 01:39:36.419
Get 'em!
- We want the boy

01:39:36.461 --> 01:39:37.754
- We want the boy!
- You get back!

01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:40.006
- Yeah!
- You get back!

01:39:40.089 --> 01:39:41.007
The boy!

01:39:42.592 --> 01:39:44.427
Grab that boy! Grab him!

01:39:48.473 --> 01:39:49.807
Grab him!

01:39:51.434 --> 01:39:53.269
And get the whore too!

01:39:53.353 --> 01:39:54.812
Grab her!

01:39:54.896 --> 01:39:57.314
Kill 'em! Kill 'em all!

01:40:12.371 --> 01:40:14.206
Stay down!
Stay down! Stay down!

01:40:21.129 --> 01:40:22.798
I... I killed her

01:40:24.966 --> 01:40:25.925
Thank you, Ollie

01:40:28.135 --> 01:40:29.387
Let's go

01:40:30.471 --> 01:40:33.641
Get that ice machine
out of the way, please

01:40:36.143 --> 01:40:37.812
You killed her!

01:40:37.895 --> 01:40:40.231
You murdered her!

01:40:43.818 --> 01:40:45.278
I wouldn't have shot her, Dave,

01:40:45.361 --> 01:40:46.988
not if there'd been any other way

01:40:47.071 --> 01:40:48.572
That's why I said thank you

01:40:48.656 --> 01:40:49.782
Okay

01:40:49.865 --> 01:40:52.200
Okay, then
let's go!

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:55.161
Get up, Myron!

01:40:55.245 --> 01:40:56.496
Come on! We gotta go!

01:40:56.579 --> 01:40:57.580
My ankle!

01:41:06.047 --> 01:41:08.174
Okay All the way down!

01:41:09.217 --> 01:41:10.844
Where are they?

01:41:10.927 --> 01:41:12.762
Bud! Myron!

01:41:12.846 --> 01:41:13.847
Ambrose!

01:41:13.930 --> 01:41:15.515
I think I broke it!

01:41:15.598 --> 01:41:17.142
Come on! Come on!

01:41:17.225 --> 01:41:18.727
We gotta go!
Come on, come on!

01:41:18.810 --> 01:41:20.019
They're lost!

01:41:27.735 --> 01:41:29.361
- Oh, Jesus
- Ollie!

01:41:29.445 --> 01:41:31.989
Ollie!

01:42:11.736 --> 01:42:13.071
All that screaming!

01:42:14.238 --> 01:42:16.573
Are they out there?
Can they see us?

01:42:26.416 --> 01:42:28.835
Let me... let me in!
Let me in!

01:42:43.265 --> 01:42:44.767
Are we going?

01:42:51.607 --> 01:42:52.900
- No
- Yeah

01:42:52.942 --> 01:42:55.069
- No! No!
- Yeah!

01:42:55.111 --> 01:42:56.445
- Daddy
- David

01:42:56.529 --> 01:42:58.447
- David, no
- Daddy, no

01:42:58.531 --> 01:43:00.283
- David!
- Daddy!

01:43:00.366 --> 01:43:01.867
Get back in the car!

01:43:01.951 --> 01:43:03.577
- Daddy!
- David!

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:15.630
Oh, my God!

01:43:18.466 --> 01:43:20.427
Oh, my God!

01:43:40.613 --> 01:43:41.614
We gotta go

01:45:40.812 --> 01:45:42.772
I told her I'd fix it

01:45:46.192 --> 01:45:48.111
Front window

01:45:48.194 --> 01:45:49.529
broken open

01:45:53.283 --> 01:45:54.409
Tree

01:45:56.619 --> 01:45:57.578
My

01:45:58.662 --> 01:45:59.997
grandfather's tree

01:46:15.054 --> 01:46:18.390
I'm sorry, David,
I'm just so sorry

01:46:33.488 --> 01:46:34.447
Let's, uh

01:46:36.824 --> 01:46:37.951
see how far this

01:46:39.744 --> 01:46:41.955
fuel takes us, huh?

01:46:45.083 --> 01:46:47.085
Maybe we'll get clear of the mist

01:50:03.399 --> 01:50:04.567
Well

01:50:05.817 --> 01:50:07.819
we gave it a good shot

01:50:09.237 --> 01:50:10.739
Nobody can say we didn't

01:50:12.741 --> 01:50:14.451
Nope

01:50:14.534 --> 01:50:16.369
Nobody can say that

01:51:45.455 --> 01:51:46.415
Well

01:51:48.625 --> 01:51:50.127
We got, uh

01:51:54.631 --> 01:51:55.590
four

01:52:00.303 --> 01:52:01.262
Four bullets

01:52:05.891 --> 01:52:07.393
But there's five of us

01:52:17.903 --> 01:52:19.655
I'll figure something out

01:54:18.394 --> 01:54:19.895
Come on!

01:54:25.901 --> 01:54:27.236
Come on!

01:54:28.529 --> 01:54:30.031
Come on!

01:54:33.409 --> 01:54:36.370
Come on Come on

01:54:36.454 --> 01:54:39.665
Come on

01:54:46.922 --> 01:54:48.214
Come on

01:54:48.381 --> 01:54:50.091
Come on

01:54:50.258 --> 01:54:51.760
Come on

01:54:52.844 --> 01:54:54.638
Come on, come on!

01:54:54.804 --> 01:54:57.891
Come on! Come on!

01:56:34.984 --> 01:56:37.486
They're... they're dead

01:56:37.570 --> 01:56:39.030
For what?
