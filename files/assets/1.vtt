- What?
- Briefly.

02:14:09.089 --> 02:14:11.216
Deliver me from L.L. Bean.

02:14:13.635 --> 02:14:17.264
I know what you two are up to and
you're not going to get away with it!

02:14:17.347 --> 02:14:18.974
This is not working out.

02:14:19.058 --> 02:14:23.103
I will not stop living and breathing art
just because you need to relax.

02:14:23.729 --> 02:14:26.356
I'm here with you. I'll live with you
in this hellhole.

02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:31.195
But I must express myself. If I can't
gut this house and make it my own...

02:14:31.779 --> 02:14:34.865
...I will go insane
and I will take you with me!

02:14:37.076 --> 02:14:40.704
Yeah. Well, maybe the house
could use a little remodeling.

02:14:40.788 --> 02:14:44.208
But why don't you just leave
this room alone, okay?

02:14:45.542 --> 02:14:46.460
Okay.

02:14:52.343 --> 02:14:53.761
I'll get her.

02:14:54.595 --> 02:14:55.471
So?

02:14:55.554 --> 02:15:00.226
Once you cover the wallpaper, knock down
a few walls, this place might be livable.

02:15:00.309 --> 02:15:03.104
- What's on the third floor?
- Attic space.

02:15:03.187 --> 02:15:05.606
I forgot to lock the attic door.

02:15:13.364 --> 02:15:15.408
- Did you feel something?
- When?

02:15:24.625 --> 02:15:27.586
- You don't have a key?
- Maybe Charles does.

02:15:27.753 --> 02:15:32.049
I have a feeling there's something
very interesting behind this door.

02:15:32.133 --> 02:15:35.970
Yeah, the ghosts of the people who died
in this house, and they want us out!

02:15:36.053 --> 02:15:37.972
Let's do them a favor.

02:15:54.866 --> 02:15:56.868
My God, that was close!

02:15:58.745 --> 02:16:00.580
I cannot watch this.

02:16:01.247 --> 02:16:04.292
What's the good of being a ghost
if you can't frighten people away?

02:16:04.375 --> 02:16:07.003
- Honey?
- No, I'm not putting up with this!

02:16:17.096 --> 02:16:19.932
- You don't know what's out there.
- I don't care.

02:16:28.983 --> 02:16:30.276
Barbara!

02:16:30.860 --> 02:16:31.903
Adam!

02:16:33.446 --> 02:16:36.074
Adam, help. I'm getting all yellow!

02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:19.911
We're trapped in this house
with those people.

02:17:24.958 --> 02:17:28.795
I can't believe we're eating Cantonese.
Is there no Szechwan up here?

02:17:28.878 --> 02:17:32.342
I plan to have a stroke from the amount
of MSG in this food.

02:17:32.592 --> 02:17:37.472
This is our first meal in this house,
so let's try to make it a pleasant one.

02:17:38.765 --> 02:17:40.767
Don't bait your mother.

02:17:41.017 --> 02:17:44.646
When we get settled, we'll build you
a darkroom in the basement.

02:17:45.021 --> 02:17:47.274
My whole life is a darkroom.

02:17:48.024 --> 02:17:49.776
One big dark room.

02:17:51.695 --> 02:17:56.450
You were miserable in New York City,
and you'll be miserable in the sticks.

02:17:56.575 --> 02:17:58.452
At least someone's life
hasn't been upheaved.

02:17:58.535 --> 02:18:03.165
I'm happy here. Those people in New York
don't know what they're missing.

02:18:07.586 --> 02:18:10.338
We could become The Summer Art Center
of New York.

02:18:10.422 --> 02:18:13.300
I could start sculpting again.
I'm only truly happy when I'm sculpting.

02:18:13.383 --> 02:18:17.054
That's a very good idea.
That'll be very time-consuming.

02:18:17.596 --> 02:18:19.931
First the house.
Otho and I have great plans.

02:18:20.015 --> 02:18:22.017
We should keep it the way it is.

02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:23.477
Good idea.

02:18:28.650 --> 02:18:32.029
The furniture truck is coming.
We must decide what goes and what stays.

02:18:32.112 --> 02:18:35.115
Everything goes,
along with whatever's in the attic.

02:18:52.758 --> 02:18:54.051
Careful.

02:18:54.301 --> 02:18:58.055
Tell me what you do and I'll tell you
why my husband will fire you.

02:18:59.473 --> 02:19:02.059
- Isn't there an index?
- No, nothing.

02:19:04.311 --> 02:19:05.771
What's this?

02:19:11.819 --> 02:19:14.613
Do you know where that's going?
Did anyone tell you where...

02:19:14.696 --> 02:19:17.576
Why are there only three sculptures?
There were four sculptures.

02:19:17.660 --> 02:19:19.829
Where's the fourth sculpture?

02:19:19.912 --> 02:19:21.706
What are you doing?

02:19:27.086 --> 02:19:30.423
"Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist.
Troubled by the living?

02:19:30.506 --> 02:19:33.050
"Is death a problem and not the solution?
Unhappy with eternity?

02:19:33.134 --> 02:19:36.303
"Having difficulty adjusting?
Call Betelgeuse."

02:19:39.682 --> 02:19:41.892
There's no number or instructions?

02:19:41.976 --> 02:19:45.062
Nothing. The "bio-exorcist." I don't get it.

02:19:49.525 --> 02:19:51.068
Straight back.

02:19:53.279 --> 02:19:56.282
Why don't you take a break
for half an hour?

02:20:17.138 --> 02:20:18.639
Put that down!

02:20:18.723 --> 02:20:20.600
What the hell are you doing?

02:20:20.683 --> 02:20:22.560
- Listen to me!
- Jesus!

02:20:24.228 --> 02:20:27.648
Why are you doing this to me?
This is my art and it is dangerous.

02:20:27.732 --> 02:20:30.068
Do you think I want to die like this?

02:20:44.582 --> 02:20:46.292
Hi. How are you?

02:20:55.259 --> 02:20:57.303
That little girl saw us.

02:20:57.804 --> 02:21:00.223
- Nobody can see us.
- But she did.

02:21:02.767 --> 02:21:05.522
- What happened to the previous owners?
- They drowned.

02:21:05.605 --> 02:21:08.525
Yes, they were family. I was devastated.

02:21:08.650 --> 02:21:11.027
- Here, take that.
- Is this the key to the attic?

02:21:11.111 --> 02:21:15.198
That's a skeleton key that will open
any door. Give that to your father.

02:21:15.782 --> 02:21:19.411
You might mention I single-handedly
decorated that house.

02:21:19.494 --> 02:21:23.289
If he needs any advice in that arena
have him come see me.

02:21:43.852 --> 02:21:45.937
Don't worry. I locked the door.

02:22:03.665 --> 02:22:07.961
Having trouble with the living?
Tired of having your home violated?

02:22:08.045 --> 02:22:09.963
Want to get rid of them
pesky living critters?

02:22:10.047 --> 02:22:14.009
Well, come on down and see me,
the afterlife's leading bio-exorcist.

02:22:14.092 --> 02:22:17.512
Yes, sirree! I want to tell you,
I'll do anything!

02:22:20.182 --> 02:22:24.269
I'll scare 'em real bad.
I'll do anything to get your business.

02:22:24.478 --> 02:22:27.230
Hell! I'll possess myself if I gotta!

02:22:27.689 --> 02:22:30.609
Yo! I got demons runnin' all through me.

02:22:31.234 --> 02:22:33.195
Come on down and see it.

02:22:33.278 --> 02:22:36.490
If you act now, you get a free
demon possession with every exorcism.

02:22:36.573 --> 02:22:38.533
You can't beat that, can you?

02:22:38.617 --> 02:22:43.497
Bring the little partners. We've got plenty
of snakes for them to play with.

02:22:44.081 --> 02:22:48.168
Say it once, say it twice,
third time's a charm. And remember...

02:22:48.251 --> 02:22:51.673
"I'll eat anything you want me to eat.
Swallow anything you want me to swallow.

02:22:51.757 --> 02:22:54.385
"So, come on down, I'll chew on the dog."

02:23:22.913 --> 02:23:27.251
We need some help. I read something
in this book about emergencies.

02:23:28.085 --> 02:23:31.338
Here it is.
"In case of emergency, draw a door."

02:23:36.218 --> 02:23:40.139
"Draw a door"? I don't know why
we keep looking in that stupid book.

02:23:42.891 --> 02:23:45.521
Maybe we should try that Beetle guy.

02:24:00.995 --> 02:24:04.081
You didn't actually think
that would work, did you?

02:24:06.751 --> 02:24:08.502
"Knock three times."

02:25:10.817 --> 02:25:12.110
Birdies!

02:25:20.910 --> 02:25:22.161
Get it!

02:25:22.995 --> 02:25:24.038
Dad?

02:25:24.455 --> 02:25:27.708
- Can't you see I'm relaxing?
- I want to tell you what I saw.

02:25:27.792 --> 02:25:31.548
What is the point of my coming here
if you people won't let me relax?

02:25:31.631 --> 02:25:33.550
Pumpkin, sweetheart...

02:25:34.676 --> 02:25:36.636
...go help your mother.

02:25:36.720 --> 02:25:39.764
Maybe you can relax in a haunted house,
but I can't.

02:25:45.145 --> 02:25:46.938
Hmm, nice building.

02:25:47.063 --> 02:25:49.107
Bad roof. Good parking.

02:26:21.014 --> 02:26:23.016
- Adam?
- This way, honey.

02:26:35.363 --> 02:26:37.365
You don't have an appointment.

02:26:37.449 --> 02:26:39.659
- We didn't know how to make one.
- Appointment for what?

02:26:39.743 --> 02:26:41.745
- What do you want?
- Help?

02:26:41.828 --> 02:26:45.791
Already? Just bit the big one
two months ago and you want help.

02:26:45.874 --> 02:26:48.126
What does that have to do with anything?

02:26:48.210 --> 02:26:51.338
You'll use up all your help vouchers: D-90s.

02:26:52.089 --> 02:26:55.175
You spend 125 years on earth
in that house...

02:26:55.675 --> 02:26:59.971
...during which you get only three class-one
D-90 intercessions with Juno.

02:27:00.055 --> 02:27:02.974
You probably haven't read through
the manual completely yet.

02:27:03.058 --> 02:27:06.019
You'll have to wait if you don't have
an appointment.

02:27:06.103 --> 02:27:09.689
- An appointment with whom?
- For Juno, your caseworker.

02:27:13.777 --> 02:27:16.071
Number 54,000,601. Ferndock!

02:28:22.975 --> 02:28:25.478
- Want a cigarette?
- No, thank you.

02:28:26.771 --> 02:28:29.065
I'm trying to cut down myself.

02:28:46.248 --> 02:28:49.126
Adam, is this what happens when you die?

02:28:50.086 --> 02:28:52.338
This is what happens when you die.

02:28:52.421 --> 02:28:55.674
That is what happens when he dies.
And that is what happens when they die.

02:28:55.758 --> 02:28:58.803
It's all very personal.
I'll tell you something.

02:28:58.886 --> 02:29:03.057
If I knew then what I know now,
I wouldn't have had my little accident.

02:29:08.731 --> 02:29:10.650
Maitland. Party of two.

02:29:10.733 --> 02:29:13.319
Take the handbook
and go to the sixth door.

02:29:13.403 --> 02:29:15.571
Oh, we forgot our handbook.

02:29:19.909 --> 02:29:20.910
Come on.

02:29:26.749 --> 02:29:30.294
All new arrivals,
report to waiting room number eight.

02:29:32.797 --> 02:29:35.508
Flight 409 is arriving at gate three.

02:29:36.634 --> 02:29:39.178
How do I look?
There are no mirrors on this side.

02:29:39.262 --> 02:29:41.139
- You look fine.
- Fine.

02:29:41.597 --> 02:29:44.225
Thanks. I've been feeling a little flat.

02:29:48.896 --> 02:29:51.899
Will the Peterson party
report to door number nine.

02:29:53.443 --> 02:29:56.362
Peterson party, please report
to door number nine.

02:29:57.905 --> 02:30:01.035
All new arrivals,
report to waiting room number eight.

02:30:07.667 --> 02:30:10.170
125 years. I can't believe this.

02:30:10.879 --> 02:30:13.131
I can't believe they didn't tell us.

02:30:16.009 --> 02:30:18.011
Oh, Adam, what is this?

02:30:22.348 --> 02:30:24.601
That's the Lost Souls' Room.

02:30:25.268 --> 02:30:28.063
A room for ghosts
that have been exorcised.

02:30:29.189 --> 02:30:30.648
Poor devils.

02:30:30.857 --> 02:30:32.984
That's death for the dead.

02:30:34.194 --> 02:30:36.279
It's all in the handbook.

02:30:36.488 --> 02:30:37.947
Keep moving.

02:30:42.744 --> 02:30:43.912
Five.

02:30:45.497 --> 02:30:47.499
This is the sixth door.

02:30:54.382 --> 02:30:57.511
Boy, this place just gets weirder
and weirder.

02:31:08.605 --> 02:31:10.023
We're home!

02:31:10.982 --> 02:31:14.069
Look at this place! Everything's different.

02:31:15.946 --> 02:31:18.031
All our furniture's gone.

02:31:18.698 --> 02:31:21.326
How long do you suppose
we were waiting there?

02:31:21.410 --> 02:31:22.911
Three months.

02:31:24.079 --> 02:31:27.082
I'd almost given up on you.
I was about to leave.

02:31:27.165 --> 02:31:29.209
I do have other clients.

02:31:29.751 --> 02:31:32.337
- Are you Juno, our caseworker?
- Yes.

02:31:32.421 --> 02:31:35.507
I evaluate individual cases and determine...

02:31:35.757 --> 02:31:38.885
...if help is needed, deserved and available.

02:31:39.094 --> 02:31:40.053
Are you available?

02:31:40.137 --> 02:31:41.179
No.

02:31:42.389 --> 02:31:44.935
- What's wrong?
- We're very unhappy.

02:31:45.644 --> 02:31:48.063
What did you expect? You're dead!

02:31:48.147 --> 02:31:52.401
We want to get rid of the people here.
We worked hard on this house.

02:31:52.484 --> 02:31:55.487
We probably wouldn't mind sharing
the house with people who were...

02:31:55.571 --> 02:31:57.948
- More like you used to be.
- Yes.

02:31:58.115 --> 02:31:59.742
But these people!

02:32:01.785 --> 02:32:03.787
Things seem quiet here.

02:32:04.913 --> 02:32:08.000
You should thank God
you didn't die in Italy.

02:32:08.459 --> 02:32:09.877
The Deetzes.

02:32:10.043 --> 02:32:13.172
- Have you been studying the manual?
- We tried.

02:32:14.131 --> 02:32:17.968
The intermediate interface chapter
on haunting says it all.

02:32:18.135 --> 02:32:21.096
Get them out yourselves! It's your house.

02:32:22.264 --> 02:32:25.017
Haunted houses aren't easy to come by.

02:32:25.100 --> 02:32:27.519
- We don't quite get it.
- I heard.

02:32:27.603 --> 02:32:29.438
Tore your faces off.

02:32:29.605 --> 02:32:33.734
It's useless to pull off your heads
in front of people who can't see you.

02:32:33.817 --> 02:32:36.236
- We should start simply?
- Start simply.

02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:39.241
Do what you know.
Use your talents. Practice.

02:32:41.035 --> 02:32:44.830
You should have been studying
those lessons since day one.

02:32:46.957 --> 02:32:48.542
I've got to go.

02:32:48.667 --> 02:32:51.170
What about that guy in the flyer, Betel...

02:32:52.463 --> 02:32:55.758
Don't even say his name.
You don't want his help.

02:32:56.884 --> 02:32:57.802
We might.

02:32:57.885 --> 02:33:01.180
No, you don't.
He does not work well with others.

02:33:02.723 --> 02:33:04.433
What do you mean?

02:33:08.604 --> 02:33:10.564
I didn't want to bring it up.

02:33:10.648 --> 02:33:14.610
But rather than have you make
another mistake, I'll tell you.

02:33:15.820 --> 02:33:17.655
He was my assistant.

02:33:18.072 --> 02:33:21.242
But he was a troublemaker.
He went out on his own...

02:33:21.325 --> 02:33:23.702
...as a freelance bio-exorcist.

02:33:24.703 --> 02:33:28.666
Claimed he could get rid of the living.
Got into more trouble.

02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:36.384
I believe he's been sleazing
around your cemetery lately.

02:33:38.344 --> 02:33:41.097
The only way he can be brought back...

02:33:41.264 --> 02:33:44.016
...is by calling his name three times.

02:33:45.017 --> 02:33:47.103
But I strongly suggest...

02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:50.356
...that you remove the Deetzes yourselves.

02:33:51.065 --> 02:33:52.442
How do we contact you...

02:33:52.525 --> 02:33:54.569
...if we need you again?

02:34:04.370 --> 02:34:07.081
Oh, Adam, that guy's in our cemetery.

02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:11.419
She's right. We just keep this simple.
We can do this.

02:34:35.487 --> 02:34:37.322
Hey, you, come here!

02:34:38.114 --> 02:34:39.365
Hungry?

02:34:40.116 --> 02:34:42.202
Come on. Hey, come here.

02:34:43.453 --> 02:34:46.414
I got something good for you.
Come on over.

02:34:46.498 --> 02:34:49.375
We'll have a little bite, something to nosh.

02:34:50.835 --> 02:34:52.670
- Come here!
- Help me!

02:34:57.467 --> 02:35:01.763
Maxie, haven't I always made you money?
That's the only real question.

02:35:01.846 --> 02:35:06.351
Nobody made me money like you.
You were a demon until your nerves went.

02:35:06.768 --> 02:35:08.478
It's just that...

02:35:09.104 --> 02:35:12.440
...Winter River, Connecticut is,
if you'll forgive me, nowhere.

02:35:12.524 --> 02:35:15.693
Why would I want to invest that kind
of money in an old building...

02:35:15.777 --> 02:35:19.449
...way the hell up there!
- It's not a building. That's the beauty.

02:35:19.533 --> 02:35:23.495
The people don't know the value of their
property. I can buy the whole town.

02:35:23.578 --> 02:35:26.456
Then we own a whole town
in the middle of nowhere.

02:35:26.915 --> 02:35:28.417
Come and see.

02:35:28.542 --> 02:35:30.210
And bring Sarah.

02:35:30.961 --> 02:35:34.631
All right, Charles.
It's just that I am kind of busy here.

02:35:34.714 --> 02:35:36.258
Just a minute.

02:35:37.426 --> 02:35:40.679
Listen. Enough of this talk
about visiting, okay? I gotta go.

02:35:40.762 --> 02:35:43.348
You take it easy up there, big fellow.

02:35:43.432 --> 02:35:45.600
- Good-bye.
- Max, wait, wait.

02:35:50.564 --> 02:35:51.481
Putz.

02:36:12.129 --> 02:36:16.216
Lydia, is Connecticut so boring?
I had Maxie Dean on the phone.

02:36:16.508 --> 02:36:20.345
Dad's found a way of making money
while I relax, so would you scram?

02:36:22.306 --> 02:36:26.351
Your mother will kill you when she sees
you cut holes in her $300 sheets.

02:36:29.271 --> 02:36:32.775
This is so corny. Is this what
we've been reduced to? Sheets?

02:36:32.858 --> 02:36:34.777
Think of them as death shrouds.

02:36:34.860 --> 02:36:37.404
And the moaning is important.
Really moan!

02:36:55.756 --> 02:36:58.258
God, how can he stand that woman?

02:37:04.848 --> 02:37:07.812
Cut it out! I'm a child, for God's sakes.

02:37:16.362 --> 02:37:19.782
- I feel so stupid.
- It's not stupid. We're ghosts!

02:37:20.366 --> 02:37:23.577
Do you want to spend the next 125 years
having breakfast with this woman?

02:37:23.661 --> 02:37:25.121
Moan louder.

02:37:33.504 --> 02:37:34.797
Oh, God!

02:37:42.847 --> 02:37:44.932
Sick. Sexual perversion.

02:37:45.182 --> 02:37:48.352
Do that weird sexual stuff
in your own bedroom.

02:37:54.567 --> 02:37:56.026
Ah, no feet.

02:38:08.291 --> 02:38:11.002
Are you the guys hiding in the attic?

02:38:11.085 --> 02:38:12.587
We're ghosts!

02:38:14.088 --> 02:38:16.883
- What do you look like under there?
- Aren't you scared?

02:38:16.966 --> 02:38:20.261
I'm not scared of sheets.
Are you gross under there?

02:38:20.344 --> 02:38:22.972
Are you Night of the Living Dead
under there?

02:38:23.055 --> 02:38:25.391
Like all bloody veins and pus?

02:38:25.475 --> 02:38:28.644
- "Night of the," what?
- "Living Dead." It's a movie.

02:38:28.728 --> 02:38:31.856
If I had seen a ghost at your age,
I would have been scared out of my wits.

02:38:31.939 --> 02:38:35.026
You're not gross.
Why are you wearing sheets?

02:38:35.777 --> 02:38:37.403
We're practicing.

02:38:37.487 --> 02:38:41.240
- You can see us without the sheets?
- Of course I can see you.

02:38:41.324 --> 02:38:43.743
How can you see us and nobody else can?

02:38:45.078 --> 02:38:48.664
I read through that
Handbook for the Recently Deceased.

02:38:48.748 --> 02:38:52.337
It says, "Live people ignore
the strange and unusual."

02:38:54.214 --> 02:38:56.633
I myself am strange and unusual.

02:38:58.510 --> 02:39:00.178
You look normal.

02:39:01.638 --> 02:39:03.681
- You read our book?
- Yes.

02:39:03.932 --> 02:39:06.976
- You could follow it?
- Yes. Why were you in Delia's bedroom?

02:39:07.060 --> 02:39:09.604
- Trying to scare your mother.
- Stepmother.

02:39:09.771 --> 02:39:13.399
You can't scare her.
She's sleeping with Prince Valium.

02:39:16.694 --> 02:39:18.113
You did this?

02:39:18.196 --> 02:39:20.782
You carved these houses and things?

02:39:22.242 --> 02:39:24.619
And this used to be your house.

02:39:25.078 --> 02:39:27.288
Why do you want to scare everybody?

02:39:27.372 --> 02:39:30.291
We wanted to frighten you
so you would move out.

02:39:32.168 --> 02:39:34.212
You don't know the Deetzes.

02:39:34.295 --> 02:39:38.258
My father bought this place.
He never walks away from equity.

02:39:38.383 --> 02:39:42.137
- Why don't you leave?
- We haven't left since the funeral.

02:39:43.430 --> 02:39:44.722
Funeral!

02:39:45.265 --> 02:39:47.644
God! You guys really are dead.

02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:52.149
This is amazing.

02:39:54.067 --> 02:39:55.610
- I better go.
- Wait.

02:39:55.694 --> 02:40:00.282
- Don't tell your parents we're here.
- Unless it will frighten them away.

02:40:00.407 --> 02:40:02.659
Tell them we are horrible...

02:40:02.868 --> 02:40:05.162
...desperate, ghoulish creatures
who will stop at nothing...

02:40:05.245 --> 02:40:07.330
...to get our house back.

02:40:09.624 --> 02:40:13.879
What if this is a dream? Can you do
any tricks to prove I'm not dreaming?

02:40:18.508 --> 02:40:22.846
If you are real ghosts, you better get
another routine because those sheets...

02:40:22.929 --> 02:40:24.723
...they don't work.

02:40:34.274 --> 02:40:35.525
Ghosts.

02:40:35.609 --> 02:40:38.153
You're telling me we have ghosts
in this house.

02:40:38.236 --> 02:40:40.532
Those pictures are of ghosts.

02:40:40.866 --> 02:40:42.117
Ghosts!

02:40:42.743 --> 02:40:46.497
Lydia, I am giving a dinner party
tonight for seven people.

02:40:46.580 --> 02:40:50.125
My agent, Bernard, is bringing a woman
who writes for Art in America.

02:40:50.209 --> 02:40:54.004
In fact, no one dining here
has not been in Vanity Fair except you.

02:40:54.630 --> 02:40:56.632
I told them you were too mean to be afraid.

02:40:56.715 --> 02:40:58.759
Don't you dare speak to others about me!

02:40:58.842 --> 02:41:02.930
Being embarrassed in front of the few
people who will set foot in here scares me.

02:41:03.013 --> 02:41:05.390
So let's play family just for tonight.

02:41:11.188 --> 02:41:13.357
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.

02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:15.150
She's got photos.

02:41:15.859 --> 02:41:18.403
Adam, you have a photo of Bigfoot.

02:41:19.071 --> 02:41:21.990
My photo of Bigfoot is a different story.

02:41:22.324 --> 02:41:26.870
We've got to get some help. We've got
to contact Betelmeyer or something.

02:41:40.594 --> 02:41:41.762
Look.

02:41:46.058 --> 02:41:47.935
It's him. Betelgeuse.

02:41:50.062 --> 02:41:51.230
Betelgeuse.

02:41:53.232 --> 02:41:55.234
Go ahead, Barbara, say it.

02:41:56.360 --> 02:41:57.778
Betelgeuse!

02:42:01.907 --> 02:42:03.451
What happened?

02:42:04.577 --> 02:42:06.746
I think we're in the model.

02:42:10.207 --> 02:42:11.709
Look at that.

02:42:34.901 --> 02:42:36.819
Where is he? What do we do?

02:42:41.032 --> 02:42:42.784
Looks like we dig.

02:43:13.314 --> 02:43:14.982
It's about time!

02:43:23.451 --> 02:43:26.704
- I say we open it.
- Maybe we should knock first.

02:43:44.639 --> 02:43:46.099
Adam. Babs.

02:43:54.107 --> 02:43:58.403
You can pick 'em! Is this
a solid relationship? Do I have a shot?

02:43:58.611 --> 02:44:01.614
- Excuse me.
- Sure. Am I overstepping my bounds?

02:44:01.698 --> 02:44:06.161
It's beautiful! You picked me.
You didn't have to, but you picked me.

02:44:06.411 --> 02:44:09.330
It makes me want to kiss you guys!
Come on, give me one.

02:44:09.414 --> 02:44:11.166
I beg your pardon!

02:44:11.499 --> 02:44:13.420
Let's get down to business.

02:44:13.503 --> 02:44:16.256
I've got a card here somewhere.
Here. Who do I have to kill?

02:44:16.339 --> 02:44:18.383
- Hold that for me.
- Whoa!

02:44:19.634 --> 02:44:22.012
- There you go.
- You don't have to kill anybody!

02:44:22.095 --> 02:44:26.850
Possession! Learn to throw your voice.
Fool your friends. Fun at parties.

02:44:26.933 --> 02:44:30.353
No. We just want to get some people
out of our house.

02:44:30.437 --> 02:44:34.608
I understand. In order to do that,
I'll have to get to know you.

02:44:34.900 --> 02:44:37.527
We've got to get closer.
Move in with you for a while.

02:44:37.611 --> 02:44:40.739
Get to be real pals.
You know what I'm saying?

02:44:40.906 --> 02:44:42.824
Save that guy for later.

02:44:42.908 --> 02:44:45.202
My wife and I have some questions.

02:44:45.285 --> 02:44:47.287
Sure, go ahead. Shoot.

02:44:47.579 --> 02:44:49.623
What are your qualifications?

02:44:49.706 --> 02:44:53.627
Well, I attended Juilliard. I'm a graduate
of Harvard Business School.

02:44:53.710 --> 02:44:57.255
I travel extensively.
I lived through the Black Plague.

02:44:57.339 --> 02:45:00.217
I've seen The Exorcist about 167 times...

02:45:00.300 --> 02:45:03.762
...and it keeps getting funnier
every time I see it!

02:45:04.137 --> 02:45:06.767
Not to mention the fact
that you're talking to a dead guy!

02:45:06.850 --> 02:45:10.020
Now what do you think?
You think I'm qualified?

02:45:11.105 --> 02:45:12.815
Can you be scary?

02:45:13.107 --> 02:45:16.443
Oh! I know what you're asking me.
Can I be scary?

02:45:18.403 --> 02:45:20.531
What do you think of this?

02:45:20.948 --> 02:45:22.407
You like it?

02:45:23.492 --> 02:45:26.995
- Will you excuse us, please?
- Sure. Talk amongst yourselves.

02:45:27.079 --> 02:45:30.249
- Let's go.
- I know, but he can be useful later.

02:45:30.457 --> 02:45:33.460
- We can work something ourselves.
- Oh, yeah!

02:45:34.503 --> 02:45:36.213
- Excuse me!
- What?

02:45:36.338 --> 02:45:38.132
We are leaving now.

02:45:38.340 --> 02:45:39.842
Don't go yet.

02:45:40.509 --> 02:45:44.680
Come on, we're simpatico.
Look at us. We shop at the same store.

02:45:45.514 --> 02:45:47.015
Hey, hermano.

02:45:47.516 --> 02:45:49.309
Yeah, there you go.

02:45:51.103 --> 02:45:53.188
We're like peas in a pod.

02:45:53.522 --> 02:45:57.776
You want someone out of the house.
I want to get someone out of your house.

02:45:57.860 --> 02:46:01.198
Look! You've been to Saturn.
I've been to Saturn!

02:46:01.532 --> 02:46:03.242
Whoa. Sandworms.

02:46:04.076 --> 02:46:06.954
You hate 'em, right? I hate 'em myself.

02:46:07.371 --> 02:46:11.041
Kids, what do I have to do
to strike a deal with you two?

02:46:18.549 --> 02:46:21.469
- Don't you hate it when that happens?
- Let's go, Barbara!

02:46:21.552 --> 02:46:24.847
Come up for a while.
We'll talk inside. Come on.

02:46:25.014 --> 02:46:27.266
- I'm not staying.
- The place is a mess.

02:46:27.349 --> 02:46:29.518
We have to get out of here.

02:46:30.019 --> 02:46:31.520
Home! Home! Home!

02:46:33.314 --> 02:46:34.732
How did you do that?

02:46:34.815 --> 02:46:36.734
Hope you like Italian.

02:46:37.109 --> 02:46:39.820
Where'd you go? Hey, where'd you go?

02:46:39.987 --> 02:46:42.490
Hey! You've got to work with me here.

02:46:42.573 --> 02:46:45.117
I'm just trying to cut a deal.
What do you want me to do?

02:46:45.201 --> 02:46:46.744
Where are you?

02:46:47.036 --> 02:46:48.871
You bunch of losers!

02:46:49.622 --> 02:46:52.500
You're working with a professional here!

02:46:56.756 --> 02:46:58.549
Nice fucking model!

02:46:59.050 --> 02:47:01.469
We can do this stuff on our own.

02:47:01.719 --> 02:47:04.931
Besides, I'm not exposing
that little girl to that pervert.

02:47:05.014 --> 02:47:08.017
We did call him,
and he seemed awfully pissed off.

02:47:08.101 --> 02:47:12.980
I don't care. I've changed my mind.
We can scare them off ourselves... tonight.

02:47:13.481 --> 02:47:15.066
I have an idea.

02:47:21.656 --> 02:47:24.575
What you did with the place is wonderful.

02:47:24.659 --> 02:47:26.202
Not me. Them.

02:47:27.745 --> 02:47:28.830
So?

02:47:33.835 --> 02:47:35.378
You like them.

02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:39.882
I hope it wasn't yet another
of your dreary suicide attempts.

02:47:40.216 --> 02:47:43.010
You know what they say about people
who commit suicide?

02:47:43.094 --> 02:47:46.057
In the afterlife, they become civil servants.

02:47:48.351 --> 02:47:51.312
Otho, I didn't realize
you were into the supernatural.

02:47:51.396 --> 02:47:53.481
Of course! You remember.

02:47:53.606 --> 02:47:56.276
After my stint with the Living Theater...

02:47:56.359 --> 02:47:59.946
...I was one of New York's
leading paranormal researchers...

02:48:00.029 --> 02:48:01.948
...until the bottom dropped out in '72.

02:48:02.031 --> 02:48:05.618
Paranormal? Is that what
they're calling your kind these days?

02:48:06.035 --> 02:48:10.540
Don't mind her. She's still upset that
somebody dropped a house on her sister.

02:48:13.751 --> 02:48:16.045
Well, this looks really good.

02:48:17.714 --> 02:48:19.466
I saw some ghosts.

02:48:25.722 --> 02:48:29.309
- It's a private joke Lydia and I share.
- It's not a joke.

02:48:29.392 --> 02:48:33.730
Yes, it is. Just today she tried
to convince me this house is haunted.

02:48:35.732 --> 02:48:38.026
Kids! You know, I love them!

02:48:39.905 --> 02:48:42.616
- Ghosts?
- In designer sheets, no less.

02:48:43.658 --> 02:48:47.037
I'd like to propose a toast
to our intrepid friends...

02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:50.207
...who braved the expressway
and two dozen tollbooths to be with us.

02:48:50.290 --> 02:48:52.334
May your buildings go condo.

02:48:54.002 --> 02:48:56.546
Lydia, favor us about your ghosts.

02:48:56.963 --> 02:48:59.341
No! I am sick of that subject.

02:48:59.591 --> 02:49:01.343
Delia, lighten up.

02:49:01.927 --> 02:49:04.096
I would rather talk about...

02:49:19.486 --> 02:49:21.029
That's cute, Delia.

02:49:33.335 --> 02:49:35.420
Otho, are you doing this?

02:51:03.094 --> 02:51:04.470
We did it!

02:51:06.097 --> 02:51:07.890
Let's watch them scatter.

02:51:07.973 --> 02:51:11.644
Any minute now they'll come
running out of that door screaming.

02:51:14.897 --> 02:51:16.398
Any minute now.

02:51:23.616 --> 02:51:25.201
It's me, Lydia.

02:51:28.579 --> 02:51:30.498
They want you to come downstairs.

02:51:30.581 --> 02:51:33.584
Delia says you can wear
any sheets you want.

02:51:34.585 --> 02:51:37.380
It was like being in an amusement park.

02:51:37.755 --> 02:51:38.673
Wham!

02:51:38.881 --> 02:51:42.593
- I didn't know I could do the calypso.
- Who has more fun than us?

02:51:42.677 --> 02:51:45.388
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn.

02:51:45.721 --> 02:51:49.308
A very sophisticated pair.
They even appear in sheets.

02:51:50.768 --> 02:51:53.980
Charles, why didn't you tell us
about this before?

02:51:55.481 --> 02:52:00.194
We're not sure we want our secret out.
Everyone will want them for parties.

02:52:00.278 --> 02:52:02.029
People will pay big money for this.

02:52:02.113 --> 02:52:06.117
The Enquirer is offering $50,000
for proof of life after death.

02:52:07.952 --> 02:52:10.955
This is it, Charles.
You can get Maxie Dean up here now.

02:52:11.038 --> 02:52:14.127
- You think so?
- Sarah loves the supernatural.

02:52:15.044 --> 02:52:17.255
She'll have him sprint up here
in his helicopter...

02:52:17.338 --> 02:52:20.008
...if you can produce ghosts for her.

02:52:23.511 --> 02:52:26.473
I should remind you that I'm Delia's agent.

02:52:26.556 --> 02:52:28.892
I have lost money on her work for years.

02:52:28.975 --> 02:52:31.561
If anything happened here, I shall handle it.

02:52:31.644 --> 02:52:33.980
But not until I've seen real proof.

02:52:34.063 --> 02:52:38.026
- What about this table?
- What do you call what just happened?

02:52:38.318 --> 02:52:40.820
What money?
Don't you believe in my work?

02:52:41.738 --> 02:52:43.239
Here's Lydia.

02:52:43.865 --> 02:52:46.493
- Well?
- They don't want to come down.

02:52:54.292 --> 02:52:55.585
Why not?

02:52:57.337 --> 02:53:01.466
I think they were trying to scare you away,
and you didn't get scared.

02:53:01.549 --> 02:53:04.803
They're dead.
It's a little late to be neurotic.

02:53:08.809 --> 02:53:10.185
All right.

02:53:15.941 --> 02:53:18.944
This was not a hallucination.
This was real.

02:53:20.278 --> 02:53:24.991
We all experienced a super-powerful
paranormal experience and it was real.

02:53:25.700 --> 02:53:29.204
Delia, you are a flake.
You have always been a flake.

02:53:30.038 --> 02:53:34.126
If you insist on frightening people,
do it with your sculpture.

02:53:35.293 --> 02:53:36.962
Drive carefully!

02:53:37.045 --> 02:53:38.964
- I'm dead.
- Where do they hide?

02:53:39.047 --> 02:53:41.424
- The attic.
- The attic's locked.

02:53:42.259 --> 02:53:44.845
They're ghosts.
They can do what they want.

02:53:44.928 --> 02:53:48.098
They do whatever they want.
Take us up there right now.

02:53:54.521 --> 02:53:57.691
Fabulous! Otho Fenlock's
"Locked Door Ghosts!"

02:53:57.941 --> 02:53:59.526
Probably committed suicide up there.

02:53:59.609 --> 02:54:01.697
- I'm enchanted.
- In there?

02:54:01.947 --> 02:54:04.867
- They must live like animals.
- It's locked. How did they get in?

02:54:04.950 --> 02:54:08.036
Open this door, Dead People,
or we'll bust it down...

02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:10.622
...and drag you out by the ropes
you hanged yourself with!

02:54:10.706 --> 02:54:13.125
- They didn't commit suicide.
- It doesn't matter.

02:54:13.208 --> 02:54:16.837
I can teach you something here.
Take the upper hand in all situations...

02:54:16.920 --> 02:54:19.798
...or people, dead or alive,
will walk all over you.

02:54:19.882 --> 02:54:21.175
Open up!

02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:35.105
Where are they?

02:54:35.272 --> 02:54:37.566
These ghosts are nice people.

02:54:37.941 --> 02:54:41.612
I think we scared them away,
so let's leave them alone, all right?

02:54:41.695 --> 02:54:43.781
It's the whole damn town.

02:54:45.032 --> 02:54:47.534
I have never been so embarrassed.

02:54:48.452 --> 02:54:50.370
Have they gone for good?

02:54:56.670 --> 02:54:58.088
Dad, don't.

02:54:58.422 --> 02:55:00.216
Mom, let's just go.

02:55:12.937 --> 02:55:14.522
No ghosts here.

02:55:17.316 --> 02:55:20.903
Come on! If they are in here,
I don't want to scare them away.

02:55:22.780 --> 02:55:26.033
We're leaving now.
You can go about your business.

02:55:28.202 --> 02:55:31.038
- What are we doing?
- Quick, quick, quick.

02:55:38.295 --> 02:55:41.423
Oh, boy! You guys are really spooksters,
aren't you?

02:55:42.424 --> 02:55:46.053
Now, let's turn on the juice
and see what shakes loose.

02:55:48.683 --> 02:55:52.478
Otho, get Maxie on the phone.
We've really got something here.

02:55:52.562 --> 02:55:56.607
We can turn this place into the world's
leading supernatural research center.

02:55:56.691 --> 02:55:59.819
An amusement park. I'll do a presentation.
Lydia will bring the ghosts.

02:55:59.902 --> 02:56:02.905
I can't bring the ghosts. They're not here.

02:56:02.989 --> 02:56:06.701
- Otho, can't you do something?
- If I'm properly motivated.

02:56:09.370 --> 02:56:12.123
What type of motivation do you require?

02:56:12.206 --> 02:56:16.085
Why don't you leave them alone?
They didn't do anything to you.

02:57:03.551 --> 02:57:06.179
We've come for your daughter, Chuck.

02:57:07.180 --> 02:57:08.556
Stop! Stop!

02:57:20.401 --> 02:57:23.113
- Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse!
- Oh, no!

02:57:25.156 --> 02:57:27.158
Why are you doing this?

02:57:28.827 --> 02:57:30.995
Leave me alone, all of you!

02:57:34.584 --> 02:57:39.506
Great choice! We spend the next century
hanging out a window or doing tricks.

02:57:40.090 --> 02:57:42.801
Maybe they'll leave now.
That snake was a nasty customer.

02:57:42.884 --> 02:57:45.011
- He could've hurt somebody.
- But he didn't.

02:57:45.095 --> 02:57:47.556
We've got them where we want them.

02:57:51.643 --> 02:57:55.605
You losers! How dare you interrupt
a professional while he's working!

02:57:55.689 --> 02:57:58.400
I'm not fond of Charles,
but you could've killed him.

02:57:58.483 --> 02:58:01.653
I'm just doing my job!
I thought we had a deal.

02:58:01.778 --> 02:58:03.864
It's okay. You know why?

02:58:04.322 --> 02:58:08.493
I don't want to do business
with you deadbeats anyway, thank you.

02:58:08.910 --> 02:58:12.747
The only one I think I can deal with
is Edgar Allan Poe's daughter.

02:58:12.831 --> 02:58:15.208
- She understands me.
- Leave her alone!

02:58:27.681 --> 02:58:29.975
Go ahead, make my millennium.

02:58:37.524 --> 02:58:41.111
I'm feeling a little anxious,
if you know what I mean.

02:58:41.570 --> 02:58:43.697
It's been about 600 years.

02:58:44.114 --> 02:58:47.201
I wonder where an everyday Joe
like myself...

02:58:47.951 --> 02:58:50.037
...can find a little action.

02:59:07.054 --> 02:59:09.139
Yeah. Here I come, baby.

02:59:13.519 --> 02:59:15.270
Hey, Adam, nice move!

02:59:16.939 --> 02:59:19.483
- Why did you build that?
- I didn't.

02:59:29.620 --> 02:59:31.956
Will you guys shut up and leave me alone?

02:59:32.039 --> 02:59:34.375
I've got all this paperwork to do.

02:59:36.669 --> 02:59:38.712
You two, come in. Sit down.

02:59:38.796 --> 02:59:40.881
Get in here, both of you!

02:59:44.510 --> 02:59:48.681
The whorehouse was my idea.
I want Betelgeuse out of the picture.

02:59:49.807 --> 02:59:51.976
You two have really screwed up.

02:59:52.476 --> 02:59:55.479
I heard you allowed yourselves
to be photographed.

02:59:55.563 --> 02:59:58.315
You let Betelgeuse out
and didn't put him back.

02:59:58.399 --> 03:00:00.776
And you let Otho take the handbook!

03:00:00.860 --> 03:00:02.027
When?

03:00:03.320 --> 03:00:05.322
Never trust the living!

03:00:05.906 --> 03:00:08.576
We cannot have
a routine haunting like yours...

03:00:08.659 --> 03:00:12.246
...provide proof that there is existence
beyond death.

03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:15.418
Coach, where's the men's room?

03:00:16.627 --> 03:00:19.130
I'm not your coach. He survived.

03:00:19.297 --> 03:00:21.382
Let me get something straight.

03:00:21.466 --> 03:00:24.093
- What's our curfew?
- Get out of here!

03:00:25.094 --> 03:00:27.680
Go on, get downstairs! Men's room!

03:00:28.264 --> 03:00:30.850
Are you kidding? Can't you read signs?

03:00:30.933 --> 03:00:32.727
I'll be right back.

03:00:44.989 --> 03:00:47.116
Maybe this was a bad idea.

03:00:47.492 --> 03:00:49.410
I didn't say anything.

03:00:51.370 --> 03:00:54.290
Who are we kidding?
You've never had a bad idea.

03:00:54.373 --> 03:00:55.541
Yeah?

03:00:58.294 --> 03:01:00.338
This could all work out.

03:01:02.006 --> 03:01:03.049
Home.

03:01:06.552 --> 03:01:09.182
I'm not sure this is the right environment
for Lydia.

03:01:09.265 --> 03:01:11.351
- Snakes. Ghosts.
- Shrimp.

03:01:12.936 --> 03:01:14.646
You family types.

03:01:14.938 --> 03:01:18.733
You've got other things to worry about.
Maxie Dean is coming tonight.

03:01:18.817 --> 03:01:22.320
You have to sell these ghosts.
I can only do so much.

03:01:22.737 --> 03:01:25.990
What are you going to do?
Viciously rearrange their environment?

03:01:26.074 --> 03:01:30.245
I know as much about the supernatural
as I do about interior design.

03:01:38.128 --> 03:01:39.420
"I am...

03:01:39.838 --> 03:01:40.964
"...alone.

03:01:51.516 --> 03:01:52.767
"I am...

03:01:53.685 --> 03:01:55.228
"...utterly...

03:01:55.478 --> 03:01:56.604
"...alone.

03:01:58.148 --> 03:01:59.732
"By the time...

03:02:01.528 --> 03:02:03.071
"...you read this...

03:02:03.780 --> 03:02:05.282
"...I will...

03:02:05.699 --> 03:02:06.950
"...be gone...

03:02:08.535 --> 03:02:10.287
"...having jumped...

03:02:12.581 --> 03:02:14.416
"Having plummeted...

03:02:16.334 --> 03:02:17.461
"...off...

03:02:18.253 --> 03:02:20.422
"...the Winter River Bridge."

03:02:23.508 --> 03:02:25.677
I don't care what it takes.

03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:28.388
You get the Deetzes out of there now!

03:02:29.723 --> 03:02:31.266
Wait a minute.

03:02:33.351 --> 03:02:35.103
What are you going to do?

03:02:35.687 --> 03:02:37.230
To scare them.

03:02:37.689 --> 03:02:40.775
I want to make sure
it's not some silly parlor trick.

03:02:41.401 --> 03:02:42.944
I'll go first.

03:03:05.177 --> 03:03:06.929
Not bad. Not bad.

03:03:08.347 --> 03:03:09.389
Now you.

03:03:09.932 --> 03:03:11.266
Go ahead!

03:03:26.198 --> 03:03:27.783
You look great.

03:03:28.450 --> 03:03:32.621
Go clean house and don't forget
the photographs and the handbook.

03:03:41.463 --> 03:03:42.965
- Coach?
- What?

03:03:44.508 --> 03:03:46.844
I don't think we survived that crash.

03:03:46.927 --> 03:03:48.597
How did you guess?

03:03:52.226 --> 03:03:54.145
Mr. And Mrs. Maitland?

03:03:58.899 --> 03:04:00.109
Hello?

03:04:01.277 --> 03:04:03.070
- Where are you?
- Dead.

03:04:04.613 --> 03:04:06.448
Dead, dead, deadski.

03:04:08.117 --> 03:04:09.994
Of course they're dead. They're ghosts.

03:04:10.077 --> 03:04:14.081
No, I mean they're gone. Split.
Out of here. Afterlife kids.

03:04:14.623 --> 03:04:17.042
- Deceased.
- Are you a ghost, too?

03:04:19.086 --> 03:04:21.630
I'm the ghost with the most, babe.

03:04:23.966 --> 03:04:26.760
You look like somebody I can relate to.

03:04:28.512 --> 03:04:31.390
Maybe you could help me get out of here.

03:04:31.849 --> 03:04:34.477
I gotta tell you, this death thing...

03:04:37.646 --> 03:04:39.064
It's creepy.

03:04:39.148 --> 03:04:40.902
Here's my problem.

03:04:41.319 --> 03:04:44.572
I've got friends on the outside
I said I'd meet.

03:04:44.989 --> 03:04:47.241
I have to be there in person.

03:04:47.325 --> 03:04:49.660
So could you help me get out of here?

03:04:50.787 --> 03:04:52.497
I want to get in.

03:04:53.498 --> 03:04:54.540
Why?

03:04:56.292 --> 03:05:00.087
You've probably got your reasons,
but I can't do anything from here.

03:05:00.171 --> 03:05:03.925
If you could get me out, over there,
maybe we could talk.

03:05:05.092 --> 03:05:08.596
But to do that you've got
to say my name three times.

03:05:08.679 --> 03:05:10.389
What's your name?

03:05:10.932 --> 03:05:12.642
I can't tell you.

03:05:13.184 --> 03:05:14.227
Why not?

03:05:14.769 --> 03:05:18.815
If I tell you, you'll tell your friends,
they'll call me all the time.

03:05:18.898 --> 03:05:22.985
I've got to go to shopping centers for
openings, sign autographs, that shit.

03:05:23.069 --> 03:05:26.155
It makes my life hell, okay? A living hell.

03:05:26.656 --> 03:05:30.576
But maybe if you have a pen...
I know! Do you play charades?

03:05:31.202 --> 03:05:32.662
- Yeah.
- Good.

03:05:33.204 --> 03:05:34.999
Here we go. Ready?

03:05:35.208 --> 03:05:36.584
Two words.

03:05:37.252 --> 03:05:38.461
Right!

03:05:40.004 --> 03:05:42.132
First word, two syllables.

03:05:42.841 --> 03:05:44.008
Look.

03:05:45.051 --> 03:05:46.511
Turn around.

03:05:48.221 --> 03:05:50.140
I don't know what your signal means.

03:05:50.223 --> 03:05:51.891
Look behind you!

03:05:52.600 --> 03:05:54.310
Hi. How are you?

03:05:54.769 --> 03:05:56.020
Beetle.

03:05:56.271 --> 03:05:58.022
Got it. Now, two.

03:06:01.234 --> 03:06:03.820
Breakfast? Orange? Orange beetle?

03:06:03.945 --> 03:06:05.446
Beetle fruit?

03:06:05.947 --> 03:06:07.657
Beetle breakfast?

03:06:08.700 --> 03:06:10.118
Beetle drink?

03:06:12.954 --> 03:06:14.456
Beetle juice?

03:06:14.581 --> 03:06:17.167
- That's it!
- Your name's Beetlejuice?

03:06:17.250 --> 03:06:20.670
You said it twice.
Just say it once more. Come on.

03:06:20.920 --> 03:06:23.465
It was you, wasn't it? The snake.

03:06:24.632 --> 03:06:27.596
You kids and your imagination!
Just say it!

03:06:28.722 --> 03:06:29.806
No.

03:06:31.600 --> 03:06:32.726
I want to talk to Barbara.

03:06:32.809 --> 03:06:35.979
You don't need to talk to Barbara!
Just say it!

03:06:39.983 --> 03:06:43.528
Adam, I can't go through with it.
I like that little girl.

03:06:43.612 --> 03:06:47.032
But it's too late.
We have to go through with this.

03:06:47.324 --> 03:06:49.659
No, we don't. Can't we rebel?

03:06:56.833 --> 03:06:58.877
I want to be with Lydia.

03:07:10.013 --> 03:07:11.932
Come on! Just say it!

03:07:14.142 --> 03:07:15.769
No, don't say it!

03:07:16.978 --> 03:07:18.230
Say it!

03:07:18.855 --> 03:07:21.610
It's okay. It's us. What's going on?

03:07:23.028 --> 03:07:24.321
Beetle...

03:07:24.822 --> 03:07:28.367
He said if I let him out he would
take me to the other side to find you.

03:07:28.450 --> 03:07:30.369
No, Lydia, we're dead.

03:07:32.913 --> 03:07:34.915
- I want to be dead, too.
- No!

03:07:43.549 --> 03:07:46.468
Being dead doesn't make things any easier.

03:07:46.552 --> 03:07:50.514
Listen to her on this.
This is something we know a lot about.

03:07:51.557 --> 03:07:54.309
And you can visit us anytime you want.

03:07:55.936 --> 03:07:59.731
I have a feeling things are going
to be better from now on.

03:08:00.691 --> 03:08:02.776
What do you mean, better?

03:08:02.985 --> 03:08:07.114
We've decided we're going to invite
you and your family to stay.

03:08:08.240 --> 03:08:09.700
That's right.

03:08:15.166 --> 03:08:18.502
- Can't we bring Maxie up here?
- You've got a stake in this, too.

03:08:18.586 --> 03:08:23.299
This is a presentation. It requires
a sense of occasion, a sense of style.

03:08:23.382 --> 03:08:26.010
- It's big. How will we get it out?
- It's sectional.

03:08:26.093 --> 03:08:27.928
- Wait, there are plugs.
- Careful!

03:08:28.012 --> 03:08:29.346
Okay, go.

03:08:31.182 --> 03:08:34.310
- What's going on?
- I don't know. I'll find out.

03:08:34.393 --> 03:08:35.811
Be careful.

03:08:37.188 --> 03:08:39.648
We've got Ed Cornwell
to head the wax museum...

03:08:39.732 --> 03:08:43.819
...dedicated to 50 great moments
of the paranormal in Thanksgiving Park.

03:08:43.903 --> 03:08:45.779
You must remember Ed.

03:08:46.739 --> 03:08:50.493
He's the genius who gave us
the talking Marcel Marceau statue.

03:08:52.203 --> 03:08:55.789
And D-Con is on its knees
to sponsor the insect zoo...

03:08:56.999 --> 03:08:59.293
...in the old hardware store.

03:08:59.668 --> 03:09:01.086
We can't lose!

03:09:07.343 --> 03:09:11.766
Lydia, you decided to join us.
I just finished the initial presentation.

03:09:11.849 --> 03:09:14.393
Now it's time to have a stretch...

03:09:14.894 --> 03:09:18.231
...and to invite our friends
to meet your friends.

03:09:18.898 --> 03:09:20.650
Are they here yet?

03:09:20.983 --> 03:09:23.778
Charles, we're here to see some ghosts.

03:09:25.863 --> 03:09:28.032
They're not here... anymore.

03:09:32.453 --> 03:09:34.914
Every time she says that, the paint peels...

03:09:34.997 --> 03:09:38.000
...and some wild creature tries to kill us.

03:09:39.544 --> 03:09:41.796
But we have pictures, Lydia.

03:09:41.963 --> 03:09:44.966
Really. They said they'd come back
and we could all live here...

03:09:45.049 --> 03:09:49.220
...if you agreed not to tease them
or make them do stupid tricks.

03:09:50.221 --> 03:09:52.640
She has a tendency to overreact.

03:09:53.141 --> 03:09:56.602
Don't worry, we're not relying on her.
We have Otho.

03:09:59.897 --> 03:10:03.194
- Are they still here?
- Otho, are they still here?

03:10:03.403 --> 03:10:06.531
They're still here. They're just hiding out.

03:10:07.240 --> 03:10:09.826
They probably feel guilty
about what they did to me.

03:10:09.909 --> 03:10:11.828
They're sorry they didn't kill you.

03:10:11.911 --> 03:10:13.955
I just want to see them.

03:10:16.416 --> 03:10:17.959
Otho, can you do it?

03:10:18.084 --> 03:10:21.212
- It'll be tricky, but I think I can handle it.
- No!

03:10:26.134 --> 03:10:29.596
What am I worried about?
You can't even change a tire.

03:10:32.515 --> 03:10:35.268
I'll be needing
something personal of theirs.

03:10:35.351 --> 03:10:37.520
You'll have to go to the Goodwill.

03:10:40.440 --> 03:10:41.816
Excuse me.

03:10:54.289 --> 03:10:56.124
The wedding clothes.

03:10:57.792 --> 03:10:59.169
The words:

03:11:07.469 --> 03:11:09.137
"Hands vermilion

03:11:09.596 --> 03:11:11.139
"Start of five

03:11:12.015 --> 03:11:13.475
"Bright cotillion

03:11:14.559 --> 03:11:16.061
"Raven's dive

03:11:17.020 --> 03:11:18.647
"Nightshade's promise

03:11:19.397 --> 03:11:20.982
"Spirits strive

03:11:22.150 --> 03:11:25.153
"To the living,
let now the dead come alive"

03:11:40.293 --> 03:11:41.586
Barbara?

03:11:43.839 --> 03:11:46.091
"As sudden thunder pierces night

03:11:47.384 --> 03:11:49.680
"As magic wonder mad affright

03:11:50.222 --> 03:11:52.474
"Rives asunder man's delight

03:11:53.976 --> 03:11:55.894
"Our ghost, our corpse

03:11:57.020 --> 03:11:58.814
"And we rise to be"

03:12:08.991 --> 03:12:10.033
Help!

03:12:18.458 --> 03:12:19.751
Stop it!

03:12:22.504 --> 03:12:24.339
"As flies the lizard

03:12:24.464 --> 03:12:25.716
"Serpent fell

03:12:26.175 --> 03:12:28.177
"As goblin vizard at the spell

03:12:29.636 --> 03:12:32.431
"The buried, dead and slain rise again"

03:13:19.647 --> 03:13:21.732
What's happening to them?

03:13:23.025 --> 03:13:24.276
I don't know.

03:13:25.861 --> 03:13:27.404
They're dying!

03:13:27.488 --> 03:13:30.199
They're already dead.
They can't feel a thing.

03:13:31.075 --> 03:13:34.161
- That's not true! Look at them!
- That's enough.

03:13:34.245 --> 03:13:35.957
Can we stop this?

03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:40.586
It's too late, Charles. I'm sorry.

03:13:48.511 --> 03:13:51.055
Where are you? Help them, please.

03:13:55.184 --> 03:13:58.479
Sure, I can help them.
But you've got to help me.

03:13:58.563 --> 03:14:01.524
- What?
- I'm what you call an illegal alien.

03:14:01.649 --> 03:14:05.319
I want out for good.
To do that, I've gotta get married.

03:14:07.238 --> 03:14:11.325
These aren't my rules. Come to think of it,
I don't have any rules.

03:14:12.201 --> 03:14:13.494
Come on.

03:14:14.203 --> 03:14:17.248
Think of it as a marriage of inconvenience.
We both get something.

03:14:17.331 --> 03:14:21.335
I get out. You get the most
eligible bachelor since Valentino.

03:14:21.627 --> 03:14:24.172
- We're even.
- Okay, just help them.

03:14:27.466 --> 03:14:28.636
Sure.

03:14:39.147 --> 03:14:40.607
Beetlejuice.

03:14:48.990 --> 03:14:50.575
It's show time.

03:15:08.218 --> 03:15:10.136
Attention, K-Mart shoppers:

03:15:21.274 --> 03:15:25.737
I'm back. I feel real good about myself.
You know what I mean? So...

03:15:26.071 --> 03:15:27.906
...without further delay...

03:15:29.324 --> 03:15:31.284
...welcome to Winter River!

03:15:31.368 --> 03:15:33.411
Museum of Natural Greed!

03:15:33.662 --> 03:15:35.831
A monument to the bored businessman.

03:15:35.914 --> 03:15:39.668
Come a little closer.
Step right up! Test your strength.

03:16:01.857 --> 03:16:03.233
Thank you.

03:16:03.358 --> 03:16:05.068
Thank you! Whew!

03:16:06.444 --> 03:16:10.073
That is why I won't do
two shows a night anymore, babe.

03:16:10.532 --> 03:16:12.117
I won't do 'em.

03:16:12.242 --> 03:16:15.205
Well, what have we got here tonight, kids?

03:16:18.167 --> 03:16:20.210
We've got the Maitlands.

03:16:20.460 --> 03:16:23.380
I think they've had enough exercise
for tonight.

03:16:30.387 --> 03:16:33.473
Not so fast, Round Boy.
We're gonna have some laughs.

03:16:53.952 --> 03:16:55.287
Mom, Dad:

03:16:58.415 --> 03:17:01.293
I just want you two to know
you're welcome in our house...

03:17:01.376 --> 03:17:03.670
...anytime you want to come over.

03:17:03.754 --> 03:17:06.632
In the meantime, the dowry's on me, Dad.

03:17:10.930 --> 03:17:15.434
The Maitlands are taken care of.
Everything seems to be back to normal.

03:17:20.523 --> 03:17:21.857
Shall we?

03:17:32.243 --> 03:17:34.620
Called the caterer. He's got a great band.

03:17:34.703 --> 03:17:37.498
We're gonna need witnesses. Would you?

03:18:27.925 --> 03:18:30.136
Let's get on with the ceremony.

03:18:30.219 --> 03:18:31.804
Do you, Betel...

03:18:33.389 --> 03:18:36.893
- Nobody says the "B" word.
- Do you take this woman...

03:18:37.560 --> 03:18:39.687
...to be your wedded wife?

03:18:40.563 --> 03:18:43.149
I don't know. It's a big decision.

03:18:43.232 --> 03:18:47.111
I always said if I ever did it,
I was gonna do it only once.

03:18:48.070 --> 03:18:49.489
Sure. Go ahead.

03:18:49.572 --> 03:18:52.116
And do you, Lydia, take this man...

03:18:52.783 --> 03:18:54.243
No! Betel...

03:18:55.997 --> 03:18:59.584
She's a little nervous.
Maybe I should answer for her.

03:18:59.751 --> 03:19:01.669
I'm Lydia Deetz and I'm of sound mind.

03:19:01.753 --> 03:19:04.297
The man next to me is the one I want.
You asked me.

03:19:04.380 --> 03:19:07.383
I'm answering.
Yes, I love that man of mine.

03:19:08.051 --> 03:19:09.093
Come on.

03:19:13.097 --> 03:19:14.390
Come on.

03:19:15.600 --> 03:19:16.976
Betelgeu...

03:19:22.607 --> 03:19:23.817
Scram!

03:19:25.652 --> 03:19:26.945
Come on!

03:19:28.613 --> 03:19:29.948
Hey, guy.

03:19:33.117 --> 03:19:35.537
May we continue with the ceremony?

03:19:38.248 --> 03:19:40.166
- Then by...
- Betelgeuse.

03:19:50.136 --> 03:19:51.388
Strike!

03:19:54.641 --> 03:19:56.059
Let's roll!

03:19:56.309 --> 03:19:58.937
Then by the authority vested in me...

03:19:59.604 --> 03:20:02.232
- The ring, please.
- The ring! Oh, no!

03:20:10.282 --> 03:20:12.075
I've got it, honey.

03:20:28.133 --> 03:20:30.218
Here it is. Here you go.

03:20:30.844 --> 03:20:33.763
She meant nothing to me. Nothing at all!

03:20:40.228 --> 03:20:42.524
- I now pronounce you...
- Yeah, come on.

03:20:44.401 --> 03:20:45.736
Man and...

03:21:45.172 --> 03:21:47.716
- What time is it?
- It's about 3:30.

03:21:49.051 --> 03:21:50.886
Give or take a year.

03:21:57.476 --> 03:21:58.644
Well?

03:21:59.895 --> 03:22:00.980
Did you get the paints?

03:22:01.063 --> 03:22:04.567
Yes. And I took pictures
of the new town hall for you, too.

03:22:04.650 --> 03:22:06.569
How was the science test?

03:22:06.652 --> 03:22:09.738
It was gross.
They wanted me to dissect a frog.

03:22:09.822 --> 03:22:13.242
I told them "no way." I said it was
against my religion. I got a "C."

03:22:13.325 --> 03:22:15.077
And the math test?

03:22:16.745 --> 03:22:21.041
You're kidding me? We spent
the whole week studying for that test.

03:22:21.375 --> 03:22:22.877
I got an "A."

03:22:23.127 --> 03:22:24.503
So, can I?

03:22:25.171 --> 03:22:28.174
I don't know.
Got a "C" on the science test.

03:22:29.969 --> 03:22:32.889
Don't tease her.
You never got on "A" in science...

03:22:37.602 --> 03:22:38.895
Come on.

03:22:40.563 --> 03:22:41.814
Well...

03:22:42.857 --> 03:22:44.317
...I suppose.

03:23:00.917 --> 03:23:03.002
This reads like stereo instructions.

03:23:03.085 --> 03:23:05.796
Sounds like Lydia got an "A"
on the math test.

03:23:08.090 --> 03:23:09.550
He likes it.

03:23:50.260 --> 03:23:52.595
Sorry. Didn't see you sitting there.

03:23:54.514 --> 03:23:55.723
Women.

03:23:56.766 --> 03:23:59.269
I don't know what her problem is.

03:24:00.061 --> 03:24:01.479
Normally, chicks...

03:24:16.121 --> 03:24:18.081
Pardon me. Did you do that?

03:24:18.165 --> 03:24:19.541
Nice work.

03:24:19.749 --> 03:24:21.835
How do you get them so small?

03:24:21.918 --> 03:24:23.879
There goes Elvis! Yo, King!

03:24:26.673 --> 03:24:28.800
Well, looks like I'm next.

03:24:30.844 --> 03:24:35.473
Good thing. I've got to do a photo shoot
for G.Q. In an hour and a half.

03:24:36.474 --> 03:24:40.353
They've been after me for months.
Some kind of underwear deal.

03:24:42.022 --> 03:24:44.941
What are you doing? Stop it.
You're messing up my hair.

03:24:45.025 --> 03:24:47.110
Come on! Whoa! Stop it!

03:24:50.697 --> 03:24:53.074
This might be a good look for me.

03:28:15.410 --> 03:28:17.954
