WEBVTT

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:12.124
Good evening,
this is Angela Vidal speaking.

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:17.049
Tonight, as usual,
we will share this time...

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:27.623
Just a second...

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:30.348
- Where does the shot cut?
- Down here.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.523
Down here? You can't see my...
This hand, right?

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:34.824
- No.
- Okay.

00:00:38.828 --> 00:00:40.127
Wait, cut.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.848
Good evening,
this is Angela Vidal speaking.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.699
Today on "While you're
asleep" we are accompanying

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.099
a team of firemen on
their nightly rounds.

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:51.025
I'm out of breath...

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.398
Good evening,
this is Angela Vidal speaking.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.048
Tonight on "While you're asleep"
we'll accompany a team of firemen

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.823
on their rounds through the city.

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:04.373
Not only that, but we'll see
things never before revealed:

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:07.948
how they live, sleep, what they eat...

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.598
We'll get an inside look
at this fire station.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.399
Join us for "While you're asleep."

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:18.574
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.399
If this is a pain in the ass, just cut,
okay? I don't want to waste the tape.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.699
Andreu,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.923
you're the boss, right?

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:31.898
- Yes.
- The organizer...

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.999
I'm in charge of this shift, both inside
the fire house and out fighting fires.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.873
This is our helmet.
It's a full face helmet.

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:44.448
You can put it on, it's clean.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.349
I'm going to be the heroine
of "While you're asleep".

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.975
- Should we put them on?
- It's easy.

00:01:52.976 --> 00:01:54.923
You're all so huge, aren't you?

00:01:54.925 --> 00:01:57.823
We're big, yes. These are the boots.

00:01:57.825 --> 00:01:59.773
Our pants are inside the boots.

00:01:59.775 --> 00:02:02.698
Like in the cartoons, right?
You jump right in them!

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.513
The cartoons copied us,
not the other way around.

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:09.014
I'm a firefighter.

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:11.524
Well, let's see if...

00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:13.955
if there’s a call.

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:17.148
- Yeah.
- Will you let me go with you?

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.248
- Of course.
- Okay.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.123
- It's like a lottery.
- A what?

00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:21.223
A lottery.

00:02:21.225 --> 00:02:23.023
We might get a call, we might not.

00:02:23.025 --> 00:02:24.423
We'll see if we do...

00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:26.648
You'll see, I'll help you out.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.949
- Perfect.
- Okay.

00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:32.098
We're going to the dining room.
It's dinner time.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.048
- Will they mind if I come in?
- No, not at all.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.499
- We can try that...
- They know you're here.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.223
...that delicious food
that firemen make.

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:42.073
- Exactly. Very good.
- Let's go.

00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:43.974
Be careful! You'll hurt yourself.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.499
- Let's go to the dining room.
- This way.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.023
Hello.

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:55.648
Bon appétit! Enjoy your meal.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.023
This is Manu and Alex,
they will join you this evening.

00:02:59.025 --> 00:03:03.273
Nice to meet you. Please,
keep eating. My name's Angela.

00:03:03.275 --> 00:03:06.374
We'll accompany you tonight.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.523
Finish eating, we'll see you later.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:15.124
- Do you want to go to the museum?
- Yes, after you.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.948
Turn around.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.698
I think I'll put it in your pocket.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.698
Won't it bother you
when you put on your belt?

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.046
I don't think so.
If it does, we can move it.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.198
Here you have to do everything.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.699
- Let's see...
- Is this right?

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.098
- Say something.
- One, two...

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.199
- Hello, hello...
- Okay, keep going.

00:03:39.225 --> 00:03:40.223
A little more.

00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:43.798
Hello, my name is Manu and
tonight the TV is here.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.399
- We'll have fun... I don't know.
- Okay.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.749
- Ready?
- A tiny step to your right.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.823
You know what?
I'm going to change sides.

00:03:54.825 --> 00:03:57.624
- If you don't mind. It's my hair.
- You're here?

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.499
So, Alex, tell us what a normal night
is like here in the fire house.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.798
A normal night is pretty
monotonous because...

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.123
- Normal?
- Yes, normal.

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:17.023
People think we run around
putting out fires, but...

00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:23.123
around 70% of the calls we get
are for other types of services.

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:25.198
- Like what?
- For example,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:33.199
broken water mains, or pet rescue, too.
Even though it sounds cliché, it's true.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.498
Or to...

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.698
This will sound terrible,
but I'd love the alarm to ring now

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.223
and everyone to run off.

00:04:42.225 --> 00:04:44.148
- I don't want anything to happen.
- Let's hope not.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.499
I mean, just to go with you,
to see what your real work is like.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.599
- Don't get me wrong.
- No, no. I understand.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.599
- It's more interesting for you.
- So we can show it.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.599
It's more exciting...
Let's hope nothing happens.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.499
That everything is fine
and nothing happens.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.023
- A routine call, right?
- Exactly.

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:06.424
So, that's a fireman's life.
Waiting, passing time.

00:05:06.975 --> 00:05:09.648
Watching movies...

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.623
- in the living room, right Alex?
- Let's go there.

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:14.625
Okay.

00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:19.888
I can't take it.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.098
What should we do?
Should we go to reception?

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.674
- All right.
- Okay?

00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:26.074
We should do something, right?

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:28.724
How exciting!

00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:30.825
Okay.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.348
- Hello. Good evening.
- Good evening.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.573
Finally! Women in the fire station.

00:05:40.575 --> 00:05:42.448
Where are you going?

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.749
- I'm sorry...
- Don't be embarrassed.

00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:48.324
Time's going by...

00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:52.874
and it gets quieter.
There's no one here.

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:57.124
The dining room is empty.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.049
They're clean.

00:06:02.975 --> 00:06:05.074
Here they're sleeping.

00:06:05.675 --> 00:06:07.574
When the alarm rings,

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:10.624
they jump out of bed...

00:06:12.725 --> 00:06:14.624
and slide down here.

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:19.573
The fire trucks are down there.

00:06:19.575 --> 00:06:21.174
We saw them before.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.499
It takes them 3 minutes...

00:06:26.025 --> 00:06:27.524
...to get up.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.399
- We got to go. The siren.
- We'll finish this later.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.999
We were winning!

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.899
{\an8}Person trapped in apartment,
in need of rescue.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:04.974
Come on, Pablo.

00:07:04.975 --> 00:07:09.074
{\an8}Bravo 128, open main doors,
public assist.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.299
What'll we do?

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.999
I can't slide down with the camera.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.974
Let's go that way. Run.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.699
- It's all ready. They're really fast.
- We're use to it.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.999
You back there.
On the other side.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.099
I don't know if I can...

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.049
It's stuck.

00:07:33.825 --> 00:07:34.749
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.049
Move your legs faster!
One, two, one, two...

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.548
Jose's driving.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:55.598
Alex and Manu are the firemen
we will accompany this evening.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.098
We're going to follow them,
and as we've seen

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.698
it's not always fires
that gets them all moving,

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.398
because the entire team goes out.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:10.498
Even if it’s stopping a water leak, or
helping someone out of their apartment,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.898
or a fire...
Don't you put on the...

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.473
what's it called... the alarm?

00:08:16.475 --> 00:08:20.748
We don't normally use it for services
like these because it's not urgent.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.023
But if you want,
we can put it on, no problem.

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:25.998
- What do you think?
- No, I don't think so.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.898
- I don't think it matters.
- Well... whatever.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.724
What's your show called?

00:08:30.725 --> 00:08:32.448
"While you're asleep".

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.349
"While you're asleep"?
Then who watches it?

00:08:36.325 --> 00:08:40.124
We have to do another take.
I said alarm, not siren.

00:08:41.925 --> 00:08:44.424
Did it make sense? Alarm...

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.799
Ready? Come on.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.800
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.448
What are you taking with you?

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:08.448
Different tools. We have
everything here in this case,

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.098
tools to open locks and doors.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.599
We're here with Alex and Manu.

00:09:15.175 --> 00:09:19.774
We're almost at the house
that called for help.

00:09:20.925 --> 00:09:24.823
The police are here.
We can see a police car.

00:09:24.825 --> 00:09:28.599
Maybe it's more serious
than we thought.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.723
- We'll find out soon.
- No, I don't think it is.

00:09:30.725 --> 00:09:31.598
Let's go in.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.998
Good evening.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.698
We have been waiting in
here for over an hour.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.699
A woman was screaming.

00:09:41.925 --> 00:09:44.523
We were called so we came over.

00:09:44.525 --> 00:09:45.899
Please calm down.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.499
- Screams? Noises?
- She lives alone with her cats.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.299
- Did you make the call?
- No.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.999
- No, it was me who made the call.
- It was you?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Yes, I called you.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.099
I heard screams so I called the police.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.248
Let's go. She's upstairs.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.449
Let's go upstairs.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.198
- It's about time.
- We got a call and came over.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.327
Okay, this way please.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.898
- What the hell is this?
- A local TV crew.

00:10:15.325 --> 00:10:18.299
Okay, everybody please stay down here.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.848
Sure, we'll sleep here if you want.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.723
Miss, miss!

00:10:22.725 --> 00:10:25.724
Please let us work, okay?

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:27.770
They aren't yours, are they?

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.099
No, they're from a local TV station.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.523
They're doing a report on how
we work so they came with us.

00:10:32.525 --> 00:10:34.131
They're your responsibility.

00:10:34.725 --> 00:10:36.099
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.899
Please stay in the hall.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.799
Am I speaking Greek or what?

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.298
If I tell you to stop, you stop taping.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:47.448
- If I tell you to get lost, you get lost. Got it?
- Okay. But we have permission.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.399
- The old lady lives on the third floor.
- What happened?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.098
It looks like she fell.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.248
They heard her scream and called...

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.848
- What about those people downstairs?
- You should have heard her screaming.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.274
She was howling as if someone
split her skull in two.

00:11:00.275 --> 00:11:02.748
The neighbors say she's really weird.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.748
She never goes out, has no family...
God knows how many pets...

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.750
But no one has a set of keys...

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.323
Please, can you go with the
rest of the residents?

00:11:13.325 --> 00:11:15.324
Go down there.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.099
Don't they have anything better to do?

00:11:22.725 --> 00:11:24.798
Go downstairs, damn it!

00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:25.723
Hello.

00:11:25.725 --> 00:11:28.024
- Get out of the way.
- Sorry, sorry.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.699
- What's the camera doing here?
- They're with the firemen.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.399
We have permission, okay?

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.299
I'm going to do an introduction.

00:11:42.425 --> 00:11:44.224
- Am I okay here?
- Yeah.

00:11:46.525 --> 00:11:49.923
Okay. We're in front of the door

00:11:49.925 --> 00:11:54.299
where an elderly resident
has had some sort of problem.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.798
The neighbors heard screams.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.539
Mari Carmen, who called the
fire department, says...

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:03.450
It's okay.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.200
Whoa...

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.499
Ma'am, this is the police.

00:12:09.125 --> 00:12:10.924
We're here to help you.
Can you hear me?

00:12:11.725 --> 00:12:14.198
Ma'am, this is the police.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.799
- Turn off the camera.
- I'm sorry.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.500
What is she doing?

00:12:24.075 --> 00:12:27.248
Ma'am, can you hear the ambulance?

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:28.473
Don't worry.

00:12:28.475 --> 00:12:30.824
We're going to take you to the hospital.

00:12:30.825 --> 00:12:32.598
What's her name?

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.073
Conchita.

00:12:34.075 --> 00:12:36.716
Conchita! Don't worry...

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.848
Come on, come on...

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.949
- Don't worry, the police are here.
- Pablo, be careful, they'll kick us out.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.299
What happened? Is she alright?

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.300
Shit...

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.499
- The light, please!
- Yeah, turn off the light.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.299
Whatever they say you just keep filming.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.549
- Stop taping!
- Sorry, okay. It's off.

00:13:06.351 --> 00:13:08.623
Unit 341, please send an
ambulance immediately.

00:13:08.625 --> 00:13:09.849
Which floor?

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.198
- We are up on the third floor.
- Be right with you.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.299
Okay. It's very urgent.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.949
Calm down. There's no need to get upset.
We're going to take care of you.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:24.023
The ambulance is here,
don't worry, ma'am.

00:13:24.025 --> 00:13:26.223
Sergio, move this, damn it.

00:13:26.225 --> 00:13:29.124
I don't want anyone here while
we wait for the ambulance.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.648
Fuck, she's biting him!

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.923
Pablo!

00:13:38.925 --> 00:13:41.324
Pablo, what do I do?

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.599
Get her off him!

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.699
Holy shit! Get him out of here!

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.099
Help! Help!

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.999
- Stay with her, Alex!
- Okay.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.199
Help me! Get out of the way.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.199
Hurry, hurry.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.573
- Holy fucking shit!
- Get out of the way!

00:14:10.575 --> 00:14:13.074
Hurry! Be careful!

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:14.598
You got him?

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.799
- Yeah.
- Tape everything.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.548
Okay, wait. Get up!

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.449
Pablo, tape fucking everything.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.398
Holy shit, he's going to bleed to death.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.399
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.748
Stop, stop. We have
to stop the bleeding.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.098
Come on, quick. Here.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.099
- I can't!
- Press here!

00:14:39.225 --> 00:14:40.849
What the fuck's going on?

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.850
- The light!
- The light!

00:14:43.075 --> 00:14:46.274
- The light!
- Quick! The light!

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:53.199
Fuck, come on!
Be careful! Cover it up!

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.599
Get out of the way!

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.398
You can't go out. They won't let us out.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.848
- Why not?
- I don't know, they said we can't.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.898
This man is wounded.
We have to get him out.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.498
- We have to make a compress.
- Are you a doctor?

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.399
- I'm an intern.
- Take him over there.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:27.199
Be careful with his head. Hold him up.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.823
Call an ambulance.

00:15:42.825 --> 00:15:45.299
The door is blocked from outside.
What the fuck is going on?

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.799
We need an ambulance, now!

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.098
Calm down, please.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.699
Silence, please!

00:15:52.225 --> 00:15:54.424
Your attention please.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.399
The health authorities have decided to
seal off the building for safety reasons.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.299
We're working to get you
out as soon as possible.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.348
We ask for your cooperation.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.749
The agents that are with you will
keep you posted on what to do.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:19.949
Follow their instructions
and remain calm. Thank you.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.099
- What the...?
- Shit!

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.049
341, 341!

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:31.223
Please!

00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:33.573
What do you mean I can't...
My friend's about to...

00:16:33.575 --> 00:16:36.098
We are aware of the situation.
We can't do anything for now.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.199
- We'll keep you updated.
- Yes, yes.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.498
- Fuck!
- What did they say?

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.799
We have to get him out of here.
He's bleeding to death!

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.599
- It's important you stay calm.
- We have to get him out of here.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.648
What's going on? Why can't we leave?

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.549
We just can't. Just calm down.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.499
Please, stop taping, for fuck's sake.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.298
- Don't touch the camera!
- Why not?

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.298
Do not touch the camera!

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.599
We have to let everyone know
what's going on here!

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.599
{\an1}Calm down.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.799
Fucking hell! Hey!

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.299
{\an1}I'm in charge here, and I say
turn it off and calm down.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.299
{\an1}Yes!

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.399
{\an3}You're in charge?

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.131
{\an3}Then do something about
what's happening and

00:17:09.132 --> 00:17:11.799
{\an3}stop worrying whether
we're filming or not!

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.499
Yeah. Find out what's going on.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.599
- Tape this!
- Please!

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.549
Would you all shut up!

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.750
We have to get this man out of here!

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.699
- What's behind that shutter?
- A textile workshop.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.499
- What do you mean a textile workshop?
- A textile workshop. We sell fabrics.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.648
Okay. Everyone, calm down.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.949
- Is there a way out from there?
- Yes, through the back.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.848
Wait a second, move over there.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.798
- How does this thing open?
- Please!

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.899
I'm not going to repeat this.
Move over there.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.449
- What are you doing?
- Trying to get out of here.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.798
Wait a second!

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.448
My husband's outside and says
there are loads of cops.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.674
They've blocked off the street.

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:58.874
He was getting antibiotics for her.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.498
Alex!

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.099
No, don't move him!

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.873
- Yes, we have to.
- He has a pulse, don't move him!

00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:16.523
Alex! Alex!

00:18:16.525 --> 00:18:17.525
Shit!

00:18:22.125 --> 00:18:24.398
There's somebody upstairs!

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.799
- Don't move him!
- Look after him.

00:18:27.725 --> 00:18:32.824
Please, come with me.
We're going upstairs.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:39.523
Nobody move from here, okay!

00:18:39.525 --> 00:18:41.624
And you, stop fucking recording!

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.173
I don't care what they say,
we have to tape this.

00:18:49.175 --> 00:18:52.274
We have to show what's happening.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:57.149
- What was that?
- I don't know, be careful.

00:19:03.325 --> 00:19:04.325
Fuck!

00:19:07.825 --> 00:19:09.524
It's coming from in there.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.899
- Be careful.
- Where are they?

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:30.149
Move over.

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.523
- Pablo, don't...
- Quiet.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.649
- No, Pablo, come here.
- Be quiet.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.099
Pablo, come here!

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.599
What's going on?

00:20:01.125 --> 00:20:03.224
What the fuck are you doing here?

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.799
Be careful.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.749
She's dead.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.149
Don't move, ma'am.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Ma'am.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.499
Don't move!

00:20:38.725 --> 00:20:39.725
Let's go.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.199
She jumped on me...

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.399
I know, relax.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.598
- You saw her, right?
- Yeah, I did.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.648
- I couldn't do anything.
- Let's go downstairs.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.748
I know, don't worry.
Let's go.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.149
Fucking asshole!

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.599
- Did you get it?
- I got everything.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.773
- Let me see it.
- Don't worry. I got it.

00:21:35.775 --> 00:21:37.223
Just let me see it, Pablo.

00:21:37.225 --> 00:21:40.824
Fucking show it to me!
How do I have to say it?

00:22:00.225 --> 00:22:02.524
Get this, Pablo! Come on!

00:22:06.975 --> 00:22:08.949
You stay here with the wounded.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.703
I'm going to check the exit.

00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:11.904
Hold on, hold on, hold on...

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.098
We have strict orders
to stay in the hall.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.100
Help me out here.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.398
These men are dying.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.348
Fuck your orders!

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.749
He's absolutely right.
You have no right to tell us...

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.273
The situation is out of control.

00:22:28.275 --> 00:22:31.648
We have two fatalities,
that's two violent deaths.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.548
And two casualties who
need medical attention.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.098
The police have blocked off the area,

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.149
they are keeping us in here,
with no explanations.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.199
So, we're searching
for another way out.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.799
She's getting worse.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.148
Her fever's gone up. She needs a doctor.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.723
Your attention please.

00:22:49.725 --> 00:22:53.223
Do not try to leave the building.

00:22:53.225 --> 00:22:56.148
All exits have been sealed.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:58.849
A BNC protocol situation
has been declared.

00:23:00.675 --> 00:23:04.348
Shortly a health inspector will
come to assess the situation.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.648
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:08.648
Why are we locked in here?

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.198
And what do they mean
by a health inspector?

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.099
- I don't know.
- What's a BNC protocol?

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.723
What's a BNC protocol?
What does BNC mean?

00:23:17.725 --> 00:23:21.698
It's a procedure used in Biological,
Nuclear, or Chemical threat situations.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.798
What? Nuclear?

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.898
Don't be alarmed.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.648
It sounds very serious but It's a
lot more common than you think.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:30.298
The wounded are stable,
but they won't hang on much longer.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.798
- We have to get them out of here.
- Obviously not through here.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.423
So, Ladies, Gentlemen, come this way.

00:23:36.425 --> 00:23:39.148
No! There's something strange going on.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.498
Our cells don't work.
Neither does the TV or radio.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.848
- We're isolated. Why?
- I don't know why.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.248
I can't get through
to my husband.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.273
- And my daughter has a high fever.
- What's wrong with her?

00:23:50.275 --> 00:23:51.474
She has tonsillitis.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.848
- She's burning up.
- Mummy, I'm thirst.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:55.898
- What can I do?
- Mummy, I'm thirst.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.398
From the office on the 2nd floor,
we can jump down on the patio.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.400
I'm going with you.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.399
Where are you going?

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:06.823
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, it's not very high up.

00:24:06.825 --> 00:24:08.324
How are we going to get in?

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.550
What?

00:24:17.225 --> 00:24:20.924
The concierge has a copy of
the key for the cleaning lady.

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:24.098
I gave it to him.
I'm in charge of the building.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.100
Let's go.

00:24:26.975 --> 00:24:29.699
There was someone else
in the woman's apartment.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.299
What do you mean someone else?

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.799
I don't know. A girl.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:36.648
Probably the Colombian girl.
Why didn't she come down with you?

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:37.898
She's dead.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.399
Come on, open up, open up. Quick!

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:50.450
This way.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.450
It's this way.

00:24:53.875 --> 00:24:54.875
Let's go.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.600
Help me.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:04.099
Go back immediately,
for your own safety.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.199
No, listen!

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.599
Get back.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:10.949
We're sealing off the building.

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:15.498
- Ready up there? Go ahead.
- Listen!

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.899
Listen to me!

00:25:21.675 --> 00:25:24.174
Listen! Can you see me?

00:25:25.525 --> 00:25:27.324
Can you hear me?

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.798
What are you doing there?
I told you to wait downstairs.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.299
Remember I'm still in charge.

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:37.798
- You knew about this, didn't you?
- About what?

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.823
That they're sealing us in.
Like hamsters!

00:25:40.825 --> 00:25:42.898
Step back! For your own safety.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.998
- What the hell is this?
- You tell us!

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:46.798
I don't know!

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.798
- I repeat, step back!
- You! That's enough!

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.298
Stop messing with the camera.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:55.398
Don't you see that we have to show
what's going on. Don't you get it?

00:25:55.399 --> 00:25:56.398
{\an1}Don't touch me.

00:25:56.399 --> 00:25:58.698
It's the only proof we have.
Can't you see that?

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.873
You're locked in here just like us.
They don't care about you either.

00:26:01.875 --> 00:26:04.474
Shut the fuck up! Silence!

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.699
Please, go down to the workshop.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.899
- Let's all calm down.
- Shut up!

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.899
Yes, we're going. Put the gun down.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.399
Please remain calm.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.999
We apologize for the inconvenience.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.548
It is of utmost importance that you
follow the agent's instructions.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.698
He is in the building with you.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.398
Do not try to leave the building.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.099
I repeat, do not try
to leave the building.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.199
Hold this. Relax, man...

00:26:51.725 --> 00:26:53.424
Let's go with the others.

00:26:54.575 --> 00:26:56.549
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.550
{\an8}Proceed with Stage 2.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.999
Please, go downstairs.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.699
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.100
Security back up on emergency exits.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.898
Let me go up to my apartment.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:14.699
I have sutures and bandages... I can
do something for the casualties, okay?

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.499
- I'll be right back.
- Yes...

00:27:25.375 --> 00:27:28.999
It's nearly 2 a.m. and we're
still sealed in this building that

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.648
we came to with the firemen
earlier this evening,

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:37.623
to assist an elderly lady who later
attacked a policeman and a fireman.

00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:39.999
They're both in critical condition.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.999
The police won't let us leave and
are giving us no explanations.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.599
The neighbors are scared
to death and exhausted.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.999
They want to go back to their homes,
they want to know what's going on.

00:28:31.175 --> 00:28:35.274
Guillem, do you mind if
I ask you a few quick questions?

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.348
I've never been in such a
serious situation before.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:44.333
I'm an intern. I give shots,
take people's blood pressure.

00:28:44.335 --> 00:28:46.335
I live in this building.

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:49.324
Well yes, these injuries
are very serious.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:50.949
This is very serious.

00:28:51.275 --> 00:28:54.398
The policeman has several bite wounds.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.799
He has a number of lesions.

00:28:56.225 --> 00:28:58.223
What's obvious is that

00:28:58.225 --> 00:29:01.423
Mrs. Izquierdo attacked
and bit them.

00:29:01.425 --> 00:29:02.798
I guess...

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.374
she had a fit of hysteria.

00:29:06.375 --> 00:29:08.748
But honestly, it's hard to believe.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:09.798
That...

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.699
an old lady could do something
like this to two adults.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.848
I guess when the doctor arrives,

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:19.398
apart from bringing supplies
to treat the wounded,

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.148
he'll tell us what's going on.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.998
We're locked in here, the police
are outside, we can't get out,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.198
we have no explanations.
They know these men are here,

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.248
and we have to get them out soon.
They've lost a lot of blood.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.323
I can't do anything else.

00:29:34.325 --> 00:29:35.924
Stay with them. Thanks.

00:29:37.975 --> 00:29:41.624
We're going to keep on interviewing.
If you don't like something you can cut.

00:29:41.625 --> 00:29:42.625
Okay?

00:29:42.775 --> 00:29:45.998
Alright, I would like is
if you could just explain

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.199
a little bit about what
you've seen tonight,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.473
what happened,
what order things happened in.

00:29:52.475 --> 00:29:55.648
I can't say too much
because I was sleeping.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.648
I heard someone screaming.
Screaming very loud.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:01.898
Of course I woke him up,
threw on what clothes I could,

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.999
and came down here.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.249
I have to change my clothes,
I can't...

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.249
{\an3}Look,

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:07.449
{\an3}we don't need to.

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:07.798
Something strange is going on.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.499
Someone did something,
that's why we're locked in here.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.998
This building has always been...

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.899
- Wait! Can I talk?
- Why can't I tell them myself?

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:21.998
- There's something...
- Yes, someone said that there was a...

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.398
- An office, a window...
- I don't know what it's called.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:30.049
A... That there was a... what they used
to do when there were atomic bombs.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.499
- A BNC protocol.
- A refuge or something.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.623
What a ruckus.

00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:37.323
If we knew that when you got here,
we would have said:

00:30:37.325 --> 00:30:39.498
Look, this is what happened.
Let everyone know.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.099
- But we have no idea.
- But, in summary...

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.649
Fireman, fireman, yes....

00:30:47.825 --> 00:30:50.824
Fireman fell! Fireman fell!

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.549
- He fell and left...
- Fell from where?

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.849
From up there... up, yes.

00:31:07.075 --> 00:31:09.323
- You were saying?
- He fell from above.

00:31:09.325 --> 00:31:10.724
From where?

00:31:12.225 --> 00:31:14.374
Where? I don't know.

00:31:14.376 --> 00:31:17.248
But from above, right?
I don't know.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:20.049
- From the stairwell?
- Yes.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:27.748
Stairwell like this and...
he fell in the middle. Yes.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.649
Pablo, is this okay or
should I sit lower?

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:32.998
At her level.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.473
What's your name?
I want everyone to know.

00:31:36.475 --> 00:31:40.374
- Jennifer.
- What a beautiful name, Jennifer!

00:31:40.725 --> 00:31:42.923
- How old are you?
- Seven.

00:31:42.925 --> 00:31:45.624
She just had her birthday.

00:31:46.075 --> 00:31:47.273
Great.

00:31:47.275 --> 00:31:50.424
So what happened? Are you sick?

00:31:50.425 --> 00:31:51.425
Yes.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.598
We know you can't take
your medicine, right?

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.748
Yes.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.999
Why not? Why can't you
take your medicine.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.748
Because my husband isn't allowed in.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.899
Please do not speak right now,

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.449
only the girl is in the shot and...
since there is no microphone,

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:10.449
{\an3}Sorry.

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:12.549
we can't hear your voice and
everything gets messed up.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:17.148
- We'll interview you later, okay?
- You don't have to...

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:20.023
So, besides your father...

00:32:20.025 --> 00:32:22.448
Who do you live with?

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:26.924
With my mommy, my daddy
and my dog, Max.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.748
Your dog isn't here either, right?
I can't see him.

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:31.798
No, he's not.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.799
- Do you love your dog?
- Yes.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.149
Why isn't he here?

00:32:36.825 --> 00:32:39.449
He's at the vet.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:40.974
What's wrong with him?

00:32:40.975 --> 00:32:43.374
He... he got sick.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.798
I knew something would
happen sooner or later.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.299
A fire or we were going to
have something serious.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.823
There must be something upstairs.

00:32:53.825 --> 00:32:56.724
If not, I don't get why
people fall like that...

00:32:58.325 --> 00:33:01.724
they fall down through
the stairwell, bleeding all over.

00:33:03.125 --> 00:33:06.048
I can't go up to my home.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.398
So, here we are.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.599
I am going to sue.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.848
I am definitely going to sue.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:16.548
I'm going to call the newspapers,

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:20.549
and have them write
about what happened.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.999
From the beginning until the very end.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:26.550
Yes.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.499
- Cesar?
- Hello.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:33.099
Hi. Sorry, but could I
ask you a few questions?

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.199
Wait... okay, yes.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.148
We want to cover the story.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:41.398
- Are you recording already?
- No.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.299
- Okay, rolling.
- Wait, I'll sit like this.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.099
If you prefer one side in particular...

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.299
Have you lived here for long?

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.448
Yes, I used to live with my mom.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.450
She died, so now I live alone.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.699
It's the Chinese.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:10.298
They eat raw. Raw fish. It smells...

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.498
They always leave the door open.
I don't know why.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:20.348
I mean, if they were the nice kind that
do Feng Shui and cool stuff... But no.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:24.399
They come in and out screaming
in Chinese all the time,

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.499
in Japanese, I don't know.
Something I don't understand.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.199
When are we starting?

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:31.700
We did.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:37.498
Why didn't you tell me?
Don't you see my face is shiny?

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.998
I think this profile's better, right?

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.473
- How's that?
- Yes. Great.

00:34:42.475 --> 00:34:44.273
- You'd like this, Pablo?
- Yeah, fantastic.

00:34:45.225 --> 00:34:49.899
Okay, silence please.
Silence. Ma'am.

00:34:51.675 --> 00:34:53.798
- I just spoke to them outside.
- It's about time!

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.899
They told me the health
inspector is on his way in.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.648
- Health inspector?
- Yes.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:03.598
There is a possible
infection in the building.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.599
An infection?

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.899
Yes, but please calm down.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:12.923
They’re just going to take blood samples
of all the residents to clarify things.

00:35:12.925 --> 00:35:16.024
- Only of the residents?
- No, of everyone here.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:21.348
When they see everything's okay,
they'll let us out.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.998
- Great.
- We ask you to cooperate.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.674
To make things easier, we're going
to go through the building,

00:35:26.675 --> 00:35:29.598
apartment by apartment, to make sure
all the residents are down here.

00:35:29.875 --> 00:35:32.598
A simple "here" will be fine, okay?

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.973
So let's get start.

00:35:33.975 --> 00:35:38.383
The main floor on the left is the
office where we were before.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.973
Who lives in the apartment on the right?

00:35:40.975 --> 00:35:43.974
That's the Colombian girl's apartment.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:50.423
Third floor, right... That's where
Mrs. Izquierdo lives, right?

00:35:50.425 --> 00:35:51.898
- Third floor, left?
- Me.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.499
Me, my daughter and my husband
who's been outside for a long time.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.399
Yes, we know, lady. Calm down.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.323
- Second floor, left?
- Us.

00:35:59.325 --> 00:36:01.298
- You?
- No, we're the third.

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.273
- No, we live...
- Do you or don't you?

00:36:03.275 --> 00:36:05.698
- Third...
- We live on the second.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.598
- I'm lost.
- Calm down, sir, you're tired.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.299
Second, left.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:13.348
- Yes. Second, right?
- Present.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.023
- Third, left?
- Here.

00:36:15.025 --> 00:36:17.198
- Third, right?
- Yes, that's us!

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.498
- You three?
- No, four of us.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.898
- Four?
- My father.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.598
- Your father?
- He upstairs.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.948
- Where is he?
- He on bed. My father sick.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:31.848
What she means is
he's old and paralytic.

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:35.649
- Exactly, my father is sick.
- Maybe all this is his fault.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.699
Listen up! We're going to finish.

00:36:40.125 --> 00:36:41.698
Does anyone live in the penthouse?

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.848
No, nobody lives there.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:46.148
A man from Madrid owns it,
but he's never there.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.949
It's been closed up for years.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.198
Excuse me?

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.599
- My father come down, yes?
- That's not a good idea,

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.848
- what if he's the cause of all this.
- My father's sick!

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:59.998
- He has to come down here with us.
- I don't understand you.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.098
Be respectful. Calm down.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.248
Miss, your child is sick too and...

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.299
My daughter has tonsillitis!

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.299
Nobody move until the doctor says so.

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:19.349
We're going in.
Don't open the door until we say so.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.800
Wait.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.723
Go ahead, 341.

00:37:35.725 --> 00:37:36.824
Okay, over.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.499
What the hell is this?
Is he wearing a mask?

00:37:53.125 --> 00:37:55.624
They'll keep telling us
nothing's wrong, right?

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:16.549
Pablo, I'm going in.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.723
- Okay.
- As we...

00:38:18.725 --> 00:38:23.348
As we were told, the health
inspector is in the building.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:26.398
There are incredible
security measures in place.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:31.008
We know nothing,
they haven't told us a thing.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:36.873
We saw Special Forces, health
inspectors wearing suits and masks

00:38:36.875 --> 00:38:40.874
and it's not very comforting.

00:38:41.825 --> 00:38:43.874
He's the one who's taking
care of them at the moment.

00:38:43.875 --> 00:38:45.123
That's all we have.

00:38:45.125 --> 00:38:46.923
- Take me to them.
- Okay.

00:38:46.925 --> 00:38:48.925
The everyone else can
stay in the lobby.

00:38:50.375 --> 00:38:52.689
What is a TV crew doing here?

00:39:07.425 --> 00:39:09.799
Jennifer! Don't touch that.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.599
- Why?
- Because I say so.

00:39:31.675 --> 00:39:34.074
Pablo, can you come here?

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:40.573
- Thanks.
- No problem.

00:39:40.575 --> 00:39:42.998
- What a pain in the ass.
- Look, Pablo...

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.598
Don't you think this inspection
has to do with that old lady?

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.699
I don't know.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.598
The policeman and the
fireman have been bitten.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:57.548
If it's contagious, they could
react like the old lady.

00:39:57.553 --> 00:39:59.052
Don't scare me...

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.299
Fuck, what a day.

00:40:06.725 --> 00:40:09.824
Pablo, grab the camera.
I can't sit here doing nothing.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.923
It's recording...

00:40:16.125 --> 00:40:17.923
and the lens is dirty.

00:40:17.925 --> 00:40:19.682
Someone's been messing around here.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.199
It doesn't matter.
Let's try to get something.

00:40:32.625 --> 00:40:33.625
Shit!

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.300
Come here.

00:40:43.325 --> 00:40:44.624
There. Look.

00:40:45.425 --> 00:40:46.425
Hold this.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.149
Be careful, Pablo.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.599
Give it to me.

00:40:56.192 --> 00:40:57.691
Can you see anything?

00:40:59.425 --> 00:41:00.824
Pablo, what can you see?

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.799
- They're handcuffing him.
- Handcuffing who?

00:41:07.225 --> 00:41:09.124
Pablo, what can you see?

00:41:11.525 --> 00:41:13.224
Tell me what you see, Pablo!

00:41:20.025 --> 00:41:21.824
For fuck's sake, say something!

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:34.249
- What are they saying?
- I can't hear them.

00:41:45.225 --> 00:41:47.424
- What's that?
- What?

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.999
The doctor has something
in his hands.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:54.473
- It's a needle.
- What's he doing?

00:41:54.475 --> 00:41:57.174
- I don't know. Wait.
- What are they doing, Pablo?

00:42:08.825 --> 00:42:11.724
They're injecting the
fireman with something.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.499
Pablo, for fuck sake!

00:42:22.775 --> 00:42:24.574
More handcuffs.

00:42:33.525 --> 00:42:35.524
- Holy shit!
- What's going on, Pablo?

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.598
- Shit!
- What's that, Pablo?

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.699
Say something!
What's going on in there?

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:49.749
Why are they screaming?

00:42:52.375 --> 00:42:54.348
Pablo, answer me!

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:55.798
Go, go. Run!

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.023
What's going on in there, Pablo?

00:42:58.025 --> 00:42:59.923
Go, go!

00:42:59.925 --> 00:43:01.724
What's going on?

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.148
What are you doing?
Guillem's in there.

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:10.448
Guillem's still in there!

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:12.648
He got bitten, we can't let him out.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:15.823
- What are you talking about?
- He didn't bite me!

00:43:15.825 --> 00:43:18.098
It spreads through saliva.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.198
We can't risk letting him out.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.423
We don't know if he's been bitten!
You have to let them out of there!

00:43:23.425 --> 00:43:25.398
The infected ones are handcuffed.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.098
Just stay away from them.

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.873
Infected with what?

00:43:29.875 --> 00:43:34.048
- What's going on?
- A minute ago they were fine!

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:35.748
- What the fuck is all this about?
- I'm not authorized to tell you anything.

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:38.873
The reaction time depends
on the blood type.

00:43:38.875 --> 00:43:40.175
We can't predict...

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.899
Fuck! Hurry up! Run!

00:43:48.225 --> 00:43:51.524
Come on, hurry up!

00:43:55.654 --> 00:43:59.198
Now tell us what the
hell is going on here!

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.148
- I'm not authorized...
- Bullshit!

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:05.598
I just killed a cop
who tried to bite us.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.424
No more bullshit!
Tell us everything you know!

00:44:08.425 --> 00:44:09.523
You got that?

00:44:09.525 --> 00:44:11.424
Okay.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.023
Yesterday we received...

00:44:17.025 --> 00:44:19.448
a call from a vet...

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:24.048
who had a dog brought in
with an unknown disease.

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.423
The dog went into a coma...

00:44:26.425 --> 00:44:29.799
and a few moments later came to...

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.898
and was extraordinarily aggressive.

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:36.223
He started attacking all
of the pets at the clinic.

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:42.223
We had to give him several tranquilizers
and then put him to sleep.

00:44:42.225 --> 00:44:45.448
We followed the chip in his ear
which led us to this building.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:46.450
Wait a minute!

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.599
Was the dog called Max?

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.500
- Get away from her!
- Yes.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.048
She only has tonsillitis.

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:03.849
- Bullshit, tonsillitis.
- Relax, ma'am...

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:06.623
We just have to be sure.

00:45:06.625 --> 00:45:09.424
Calm down.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.048
It’s just tonsillitis.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:16.548
We think the dog spread the infection...

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:19.223
through his saliva.

00:45:19.225 --> 00:45:20.225
If that’s true...

00:45:31.875 --> 00:45:34.198
Handcuffs! Get the handcuffs!

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.399
- Hold her!
- Jennifer!

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.299
Jennifer!

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.999
The cuffs!

00:45:45.325 --> 00:45:51.399
- Jennifer!
- Relax, we'll get her.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:57.048
Father downstairs.
My father come down!

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:59.698
- What father?
- Her father's sick in bed.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.399
And you didn't tell me?

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:05.523
We can't have infected
people loose out there.

00:46:05.525 --> 00:46:09.223
We gave you specific orders to get
everyone together downstairs.

00:46:09.225 --> 00:46:12.224
We had no idea. We thought
everyone was here.

00:46:13.125 --> 00:46:15.223
Take this. Go up and find the girl.

00:46:15.225 --> 00:46:17.398
Give her the injection and
get her down here quickly.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.098
Everyone must come down here.

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:23.098
Pablo, go with them! Record everything!

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.599
Be careful, Pablo!

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.100
Jennifer?

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:40.349
What the hell is that?
What was that?

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:49.349
Fucking hell!

00:46:50.425 --> 00:46:53.024
- The old lady isn't there.
- Neither is the other one.

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:10.450
Jennifer?

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:18.300
Jennifer.

00:47:28.675 --> 00:47:30.674
There's no one here. Wait.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.599
She's over there. Look!

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:37.500
Fuck!

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:43.249
Jennifer, relax.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Relax.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.398
Give me the needle.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.448
- The needle!
- Are you sure?

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:50.450
Yes.

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:54.549
Be careful, man.

00:47:57.625 --> 00:47:58.625
Jennifer.

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:01.450
Relax.

00:48:04.025 --> 00:48:05.724
Give me your hand.

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:10.249
- Be careful.
- Give me your hand.

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:13.099
What happened to her eyes?

00:48:14.125 --> 00:48:15.125
It's because she-

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:31.250
Shit!

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:41.649
Be careful!

00:48:42.275 --> 00:48:46.174
Shit! Get out of the way!

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.899
Go, she bit me!

00:48:55.225 --> 00:48:57.824
She bit me, can't you see?

00:48:58.125 --> 00:49:00.124
Go, for fuck's sake!

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:21.900
Go!

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.799
Let's go!

00:49:26.425 --> 00:49:28.924
No down!

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:34.399
Don't go down there!
They're getting away!

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:42.049
Help me!

00:49:47.725 --> 00:49:51.023
Take these off of me!

00:49:51.025 --> 00:49:53.098
- Don't touch me!
- Son of a bitch!

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:55.699
Take them off!

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.599
- Lady! Get up stairs now!
- I don't have it.

00:50:01.025 --> 00:50:03.098
- I don't have the key!
- What do you mean?

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.923
- The policeman has it.
- What?!

00:50:04.925 --> 00:50:06.498
- The policeman has it.
- Fuck!

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.599
We have to get her out of here!

00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:13.075
Help!

00:50:14.125 --> 00:50:15.125
Help!

00:50:15.725 --> 00:50:16.924
Help!

00:50:18.625 --> 00:50:21.524
Help, you bastard!

00:50:22.125 --> 00:50:23.125
Don't go!

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:27.799
Get away!

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.999
We have to get her out of here.

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.699
- Let's go.
- No! We can't leave her!

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.799
I'm sorry!

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:38.149
Don't leave me here!

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.899
This way, come on.

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.799
Hurry up!

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:49.249
The lock!

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:13.648
It looks like they're leaving.

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:15.149
They're going upstairs.

00:51:17.325 --> 00:51:18.823
- Were you bitten?
- No.

00:51:18.825 --> 00:51:19.998
- Angela?
- No.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.699
- You?
- No.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.699
- Did you find the little girl?
- Who cares about the girl?

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:26.549
It's out of control.

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:31.098
Pablo, what the hell were
they doing to that woman?

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:33.623
They were eating her alive, Manu.

00:51:33.625 --> 00:51:34.898
What the hell is this?

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:37.448
I don't know!

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:40.149
They could all be infected by now.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.448
We have to get out of here.

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:44.698
- I'm not moving!
- We have to get out of here!

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:49.173
No! We can stay here...

00:51:49.175 --> 00:51:51.648
until they come to get us.
These things...

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:54.223
No one's going to come get us!

00:51:54.225 --> 00:51:54.623
Yes!

00:51:54.625 --> 00:51:57.723
Open your fucking eyes!
They don't give a shit!

00:51:57.725 --> 00:51:59.573
They're going to let us die here!

00:51:59.575 --> 00:52:04.198
But the doctor does matter to them!
They'll come get the doctor.

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.898
The doctor? Why?

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.598
- He is in there.
- Son of a bitch!

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.423
- Where?
- There!

00:52:10.425 --> 00:52:13.224
I'm gonna kill you!

00:52:14.425 --> 00:52:17.124
I've been bitten. Go away.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:19.469
Get lost.

00:52:19.471 --> 00:52:20.919
I've been bitten!

00:52:21.475 --> 00:52:22.774
Get back!

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:27.523
Go away!

00:52:27.525 --> 00:52:29.024
Shit, shit...

00:52:30.575 --> 00:52:33.998
The door won't hold.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.399
- Go away.
- Son of a bitch!

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.298
Get us out of here!

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:42.098
Stand away from the windows!

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:45.398
We repeat:
Stay away from the windows

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.598
or we will be forced to
take drastic measures.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:52.199
Follow the inspector's instructions.

00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:58.049
There might be a way out.

00:53:00.225 --> 00:53:03.024
Pablo, there might be a way out!

00:53:04.025 --> 00:53:06.223
Listen!

00:53:06.225 --> 00:53:09.598
There's an underground
storage area in the workshop

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.399
that has a drain cover that
joins up with the sewers.

00:53:14.125 --> 00:53:15.224
Can you hear me?

00:53:17.175 --> 00:53:19.998
- In the workshop there's a basement...
- Are you sure?

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.123
Yes, we can escape through there.
The problem is the reinforced door.

00:53:24.125 --> 00:53:27.324
- How the hell will we open it?
- With the key!

00:53:28.275 --> 00:53:30.673
The intern is in charge.
He has all the keys.

00:53:30.675 --> 00:53:32.725
- Where?
- In his apartment.

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:48.198
Let's go! Let's go!

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.199
He's been bitten!

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:54.449
Hurry up!

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:02.399
They're not there.

00:54:07.925 --> 00:54:12.223
Manu, we have to find the way out.
We need the storage key.

00:54:12.225 --> 00:54:13.798
Yeah, but... how?

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.698
The intern has the key,
but we don't know where he lives.

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:18.399
You checked the list!

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:21.023
- I can't remember.
- Pablo?

00:54:21.025 --> 00:54:22.524
I don't remember either.

00:54:23.725 --> 00:54:25.567
Manu, think.

00:54:25.925 --> 00:54:27.925
I'm sure you can remember.

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:31.549
- I can't remember!
- Think, Manu!

00:54:32.275 --> 00:54:34.774
Guillem! The mailboxes!

00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:36.949
He's called Guillem...

00:54:48.575 --> 00:54:52.274
Downstairs, quick! Angela, hurry up!

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.800
Hurry up!

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:07.249
Here! Guillem Marimón,
third floor No. 2!

00:55:09.875 --> 00:55:11.974
She's cuffed. We can get by.

00:55:12.925 --> 00:55:15.424
We have to go upstairs.

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.699
Upstairs!

00:55:39.675 --> 00:55:40.974
Be careful, Angela!

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.199
Pablo, help me!

00:55:59.025 --> 00:56:01.024
Wait. Okay.

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:03.424
Drop her.

00:56:13.925 --> 00:56:16.973
- I got bitten!
- No, you didn't.

00:56:16.975 --> 00:56:19.323
I saw it. You didn't.

00:56:19.325 --> 00:56:21.723
Let's go upstairs. Pablo, help.

00:56:21.725 --> 00:56:24.298
- Come on, get up.
- I got bitten!

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:28.248
You did not, Angela!
I saw it, you didn't!

00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:30.442
Let's go, Pablo! Hurry up!

00:56:32.925 --> 00:56:34.398
Hurry up!

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.298
Shit!

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:39.523
- The light!
- Where's the switch?

00:56:39.525 --> 00:56:43.073
- On the wall!
- I can't find it!

00:56:43.075 --> 00:56:46.273
- Pablo, the spotlight! Turn it on!
- I'm trying!

00:56:46.275 --> 00:56:47.275
Quickly!

00:56:53.025 --> 00:56:55.024
Move it! Move it!

00:57:03.325 --> 00:57:05.824
Shit! Go upstairs, hurry!

00:57:17.325 --> 00:57:20.024
- The mallet, Angela!
- Quick! Give it to him!

00:57:21.025 --> 00:57:22.730
Go upstairs, quickly!

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.199
It's here.

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.199
Move!

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:41.199
Hurry up. I'll wait here. Quickly!

00:57:51.825 --> 00:57:52.825
I'll go there.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000
Where are they?

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.399
Look in the drawers.

00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:04.849
Where the hell are they?

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:08.599
We have to get out!

00:58:09.725 --> 00:58:12.824
- Here, here!
- Shit, where are they?

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:17.800
Shit!

00:58:27.025 --> 00:58:28.224
The keys...

00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:31.050
Where are...

00:58:46.526 --> 00:58:48.058
The keys!

00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:53.149
Which ones are they?

00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:55.274
Which ones are they?

00:58:55.276 --> 00:58:57.474
I don't know. Grab them all.

00:58:58.700 --> 00:58:59.799
Let's go.

00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:09.299
Where is he? Where's Manu?

00:59:14.075 --> 00:59:16.223
Upstairs, run!

00:59:16.225 --> 00:59:19.324
Go to the penthouse!
The key must be in the bunch.

00:59:21.775 --> 00:59:23.174
Come on, Angela!

00:59:24.525 --> 00:59:25.525
Which one is it?

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:30.400
This one!

00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:45.749
- Turn on the spotlight.
- I can't!

00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:49.098
The light is loose.

00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:50.898
Fix it, Pablo!

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:52.399
I'm trying!

00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:57.450
They're leaving.

00:59:58.825 --> 01:00:02.423
- Pablo, turn it on!
- Calm down.

01:00:02.425 --> 01:00:04.448
This is the apartment
that was closed up.

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:08.886
- No one will be in here.
- Turn it on, please.

01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:11.850
Okay.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.298
- Shit...
- Where are we?

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:23.300
I don't know.

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.201
What the hell is all this?

01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:41.298
Pablo, over here.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.300
Where?

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:47.550
Holy shit!

01:00:50.325 --> 01:00:53.624
- What does this mean?
- I don't know.

01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:00.988
Pablo!

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.299
"The Vatican is investigating...

01:01:09.425 --> 01:01:12.324
the possible possession
of a Portuguese girl."

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:19.023
PORTUGAL IS MOVED BY
THE CASE OF A POSSESSED GIRL

01:01:19.025 --> 01:01:21.224
- Fuck...
- The possessed girl.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.398
THE MEDEIROS CASE ON HOLD

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.400
Pablo, look!

01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:32.449
It's the same girl!

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.999
What the hell is this?

01:01:38.825 --> 01:01:40.973
It's all about the same.

01:01:40.975 --> 01:01:43.973
"The hospital denies releasing the
girl who disappeared in the night..."

01:01:43.975 --> 01:01:46.275
Pablo... oh Jesus...

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.099
Pablo!

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.848
Calm down.

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:02.549
It's just a noise. It must be the pipes.

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:07.373
Calm down, we'll find a way out.

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:09.374
We have to get out of here.

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:13.299
Be careful. Stay close.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:41.399
Didn't they say no one lived here?

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:44.449
Calm down.

01:02:59.875 --> 01:03:02.123
Pablo.

01:03:02.125 --> 01:03:04.424
Give me some light. Oh Jesus.

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:10.749
What's that?

01:03:12.325 --> 01:03:14.173
They're still talking about the same.

01:03:15.075 --> 01:03:16.623
What the hell is this?

01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:20.923
- Angela, let's go.
- Wait!

01:03:20.925 --> 01:03:22.724
It must have something to do with...

01:03:25.025 --> 01:03:26.025
Look!

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.800
A tape recorder.

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:32.949
- There's no electricity.
- It's off.

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:36.324
There.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:37.448
Got it!

01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:39.898
I've finally isolated the enzyme.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.199
The problem is that it's unstable.

01:03:43.303 --> 01:03:46.802
It deteriorates when it comes
into contact with oxygen.

01:03:47.675 --> 01:03:49.674
I am, however, optimistic.

01:03:50.103 --> 01:03:52.702
If all goes well, we'll
have a vaccine soon.

01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:56.249
- The analysis were successful.
- What the hell is he talking about, Pablo?

01:04:03.226 --> 01:04:06.125
Something unexpected has happened.

01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:11.149
The enzyme is not only
resistant but has mutated.

01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:14.949
It behaves much like the flu.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.199
This leads us to a horrible conclusion.

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.698
It might be contagious.

01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.700
I don't get it.

01:04:23.225 --> 01:04:24.898
The telegram from Rome has arrived.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.323
The Medeiros girl must die.

01:04:28.025 --> 01:04:29.924
He's talking about the girl, Pablo.

01:04:31.525 --> 01:04:32.824
She was here.

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.199
I must eliminate her and erase
all signs of her existence.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.099
What the hell is this guy saying?

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:43.523
- Finally my prayers have been answered.
- We have to get out of here.

01:04:43.525 --> 01:04:46.124
This decision should have
been made years ago.

01:04:47.575 --> 01:04:49.874
This has all been a big mistake.

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.898
I must follow the procedures.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.199
The ritual is very specific.

01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.398
I cannot afford to make a mistake.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.423
Come here. Stay close.

01:04:59.425 --> 01:05:01.824
I'm going to seal off the room.

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:05.699
The seal should keep her in.

01:05:06.575 --> 01:05:10.174
If anything goes wrong, may God help us.

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:21.350
Wait.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.398
- I'm going to look.
- No! Pablo, no!

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.499
There might be a way
out through the attic.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.523
- We have to give it a try.
- What are you going to do?

01:05:32.525 --> 01:05:34.524
I'll record what's up there
and we can look at it.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:45.699
Pablo. Bring the camera down.
There are really weird noises.

01:05:58.675 --> 01:06:01.048
- What happened?
- Something hit the camera.

01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:04.048
What do you mean something hit the camera?
Turn it on!

01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:06.149
The fucking light broke!

01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:10.049
- Turn it on, Pablo!
- I can't, it's busted.

01:06:11.775 --> 01:06:15.223
- Fuck! What now?
- Relax. Don't move.

01:06:15.225 --> 01:06:17.324
I'll turn on the night vision.

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:20.599
Okay, I can see you now.

01:06:21.425 --> 01:06:22.623
That's good.

01:06:22.625 --> 01:06:24.698
Stick your hand out.

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:27.399
- I can't see you. Where are you?
- Okay, I got you.

01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:32.949
Relax, it's me. It's okay, it's me.

01:06:33.375 --> 01:06:35.098
I can see if I use the camera.

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:37.798
Get behind me and don't let go.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.800
Hold on tight.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:44.399
We'll be okay.
We're going to get out.

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:50.623
I'll find the way out, I swear.

01:06:50.625 --> 01:06:52.424
Don't let go, okay?

01:07:03.025 --> 01:07:04.025
Stay still.

01:07:05.825 --> 01:07:07.548
Why? What is it?

01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:10.949
There's something. Go back.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.099
Don't make a sound.

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.100
Get down.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.999
Keep quiet, for God's sake!

01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:43.949
It can't see us.
If it can't hear us, it won't find us.

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:32.699
Let's go.

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:54.699
- Run! Go!
- Pablo!

01:09:08.575 --> 01:09:10.574
Run!

01:09:11.350 --> 01:09:13.950
Get out of here! Go, go, go!

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:44.099
Answer me! I can't hear you!

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:49.800
Pablo.

01:10:28.625 --> 01:10:32.065
We have to tape everything, Pablo.
For fuck's sake.
