00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:42.001
The year, 1462.

00:00:42.168 --> 00:00:45.504
Constantinople had fallen.

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:49.467
Moslem Turks swept into Europe
with a vast superior force,

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:53.679
striking at Romania,
threatening all of Christendom.

00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:56.140
From Transylvania arose
a Romanian knight

00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:58.350
of the Sacred Order of the Dragon

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.936
known as Dracula.

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:21.832
On the eve of the battle,
his bride, Elizabeta,

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:25.169
whom he prized
above all things on earth,

00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:29.548
knew that he must face
an insurmountable force

00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:34.386
from which he might never return.

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:35.072
God be praised, I am victorious.

00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:47.751
Elizabeta.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.258
The vengeful Turks
shot an arrow into the castle

00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:57.011
carrying false news
of Dracula's death.

00:02:57.178 --> 00:03:03.058
Elizabeta, believing him dead,
flung herself into the river.

00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:43.724
My prince is dead.

00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:46.101
All is lost without him.

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:50.231
May God unite us in heaven.

00:04:03.202 --> 00:04:05.704
She has taken her own life.

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:08.666
Her soul cannot be saved.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.835
She is damned.

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.380
It is God's law.

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:25.891
Is this my reward
for defending God's church?

00:04:26.517 --> 00:04:27.559
Sacrilege!

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:31.188
I renounce God!

00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:36.193
I shall rise from
my own death

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.698
to avenge hers with all
the powers of darkness.

00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:02.011
The blood is the life

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:06.807
and it shall be mine!

00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:06.950
I've done everything
that you asked, master.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:12.164
All the preparations are
in order. Everything.

00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:16.877
I await your command,
for I know

00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:21.173
that when the rewards
are given,

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.010
I will be one of those who
benefits from your generosity.

00:06:30.474 --> 00:06:32.768
Thank you.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:36.730
Gone mad.
Renfield is deranged.

00:06:38.482 --> 00:06:40.567
He's lost his greedy mind,
poorchap.

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:43.320
I want you to take over
for his foreign client,

00:06:43.487 --> 00:06:45.406
this rather eccentric
Count Dracula.

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:47.908
He's buying up property
around London.

00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:51.912
Of course, sir. I'll attend to the count.
Thank you for your confidence.

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:55.040
This is a great opportunity
for you, Harker.

00:06:55.207 --> 00:06:58.252
You'll have to leave for
Transylvania immediately.

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.089
Opportunities such as this
come but once in a lifetime.

00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:04.591
Yes, of course, sir.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:10.013
If I may I enquire, what in fact happened
to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.393
Nothing. Nothing.
Personal problems.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.731
Close these transactions, and your
future with this firm is assured.

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:24.236
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

00:07:26.405 --> 00:07:29.324
We've waited this long,
haven't we?

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.618
We can be married
when I return.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.080
Ahem. Of course.

00:07:35.247 --> 00:07:37.374
I'll write.

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:41.837
Jonathan. Jonathan.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:50.012
Jonathan, I love you.
I love you, Mina.

00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:24.129
Twenty-fifth May, Budapest.
Left Budapest early this morning.

00:08:24.296 --> 00:08:29.676
The impression I had was that we were
leaving the West and entering the East.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:33.764
The district I am to enter is in
the extreme east of the country

00:08:33.931 --> 00:08:35.641
just on the borders
of three states:

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:38.227
Transylvania, Moldavia
and Bukovina,

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:40.562
in the midst
of the Carpathian Mountains.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:44.441
One of the wildest
and least known portions of Europe.

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:52.616
My friend,
welcome to the Carpathians.

00:08:52.783 --> 00:08:56.161
I am anxiously expecting you.

00:08:56.328 --> 00:09:01.917
At the Borgo Pass, my carriage
will await you and bring you to me.

00:09:02.084 --> 00:09:06.964
I trust your journey from London
has been a happy one

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:13.136
and that you will enjoy your stay
in my beautiful land.

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:17.891
Your friend, D.

00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:28.360
Diary, 25th May.

00:09:28.527 --> 00:09:31.822
My dear Jonathan
has been gone almost a week.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.742
And although I was disappointed we
could not marry before his departure,

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:39.037
I am happy that he got sent
on this important assignment.

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:42.040
I am longing to hear all the news.

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:46.253
It must be so nice
to see strange countries.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:52.718
I wonder if we, I mean Jonathan
and I, shall ever see them together.

00:10:06.023 --> 00:10:10.027
We're early, driver.
No one is here.

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:12.654
For the dead travel fast.

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:30.857
I say, is the castle far?

00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:53.482
Welcome to my home.

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:58.820
Enter freely of your own will and leave
some of the happiness you bring.

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:04.868
Count Dracula?
I am Dracula.

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:09.956
And I bid you welcome,
Mr. Harker, to my house.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.128
Come in.

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:33.021
You will, I trust, excuse me

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:36.399
that I do not join you.

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:40.862
But I have already dined,

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:45.158
and I never drink...

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:49.246
wine.

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:58.421
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:02.926
The order of the Dracul.

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:07.180
The Dragon.

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:13.436
An ancient society
pledging my forefathers

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:19.442
to defend the Church
against all enemies of Christ.

00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:27.200
That relationship
was not entirely successful.

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.078
Oh, yes.

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:37.377
It is no laughing matter.

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:43.967
We Draculs have a right
to be proud.

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:46.761
What devil or witch
was ever so great as Attila

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:51.474
whose blood flows
in these veins?

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:56.813
Blood...

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:07.282
Is too precious a thing
in these times.

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:14.331
The warlike days are over.

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:22.172
The victories of my great race
are but a tale to be told.

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:30.931
I am the last
of my kind.

00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:38.146
I have offended you with my
ignorance, count. Forgive me.

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:55.914
I do so long to go through the crowded
streets of your mighty London.

00:15:56.081 --> 00:16:00.835
To be in the midst of the whirl
and the rush of humanity.

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:06.508
To share its life,
its changes, its death.

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:10.762
There. You, count, are--

00:16:12.555 --> 00:16:17.519
Are the owner of Carfax Abbey
in Purfleet. Congratulations.

00:16:17.686 --> 00:16:21.982
Your firm writes most
highly of your talents.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:25.610
They say
you are a man of good...

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:28.154
taste.

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:34.619
And that you are a worthy
substitute to your predecessor,

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.955
Mr. Renfield.

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:39.958
You may rely on me,
count

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:41.418
Forgive my curiosity,

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:45.005
but why 10 houses in such precise
locations around London?

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:48.091
Is it to raise
the market value?

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:54.639
Do you believe in destiny?

00:16:56.307 --> 00:17:01.146
That even the powers of time

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:06.818
can be altered
for a single purpose?

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:18.788
The luckiest man who walks
on this earth is the one who finds...

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:22.042
true love.

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:27.380
You found Mina.
I thought she was lost.

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:30.633
We're to be married
as soon as I return.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.262
Are you married, count?

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:36.097
Sir, are you married?

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:38.058
I...

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:41.686
I was married once.

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:44.481
Ages ago, it seems.

00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:47.275
She died.

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:53.073
Oh. I'm very sorry.
She was fortunate.

00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:59.204
My life, at its best, is misery.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.296
She will, no doubt,
make a devoted wife,

00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:12.300
and you,
a faithful husband.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.762
Come.

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:21.267
Write now, my friend,
to your firm and to any loved ones

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:27.982
and say that it should please you to
stay with me until a month from now.

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:34.405
A month? Do you wish me
to stay so long?

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:41.121
I will take no refusal.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.510
Diary, 30th of May,
1897.

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:59.848
I know that Jonathan does not want me to
stay here with Lucy while he is away.

00:19:00.723 --> 00:19:02.392
He thinks that if I
become accustomed

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:05.186
to the wealth and privileges
of the Weston family,

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:09.149
I will not be content as the wife
of a mere clerk in a law firm.

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:12.110
But Lucy and I have been friends
since we were children.

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:16.489
And she has never minded
that I am only a schoolmistress.

00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:26.833
Oh, how disgustingly awful.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.212
Mina.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.340
Mina.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:41.139
Oh, Mina,
you're always working.

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:43.099
Is your ambitious John Harker

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:46.811
forcing you to learn
that ridiculous machine?

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:49.314
When he could be
forcing you to perform

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.776
unspeakable acts of desperate
passion on the parlor ﬂoor.

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:58.823
Lucy, really. You shouldn't talk
about my fiancé in such a way.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.452
There's more to marriage
than carnal pleasures.

00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:07.624
Oh, Mina. So I see.
Much, much more.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:12.462
Oh. Oh, that's--

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:16.966
What is it, Lucy?

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:20.220
Oh, Mina.
Because I don't understand it.

00:20:20.386 --> 00:20:25.058
Can man and woman
really do that?

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:29.437
I did. Only last night.
Fibber. You did not.

00:20:29.604 --> 00:20:35.026
Yes, I did.
Well, in my dreams.

00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:40.865
Jonathan measures up,
doesn't he? You can tell Lucy.

00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:43.576
We've kissed, that's all.

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:47.914
He thinks he's too poor
to marry me.

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:51.292
It's all the worse now that I'm here
visiting you at Hillingham,

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:53.044
my rich friend.

00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:56.589
Yes, but not even one
marriage proposal.

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:59.217
And here I am, almost 20.

00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:01.594
Practically a hag.

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:10.311
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.

00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:15.441
- Oh, look.
- What is that?

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:17.819
A Texan.

00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:20.029
Quincey P. Morris.

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.949
He's so young and fresh,

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:25.326
like a wild stallion
between my legs.

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.453
You're positively indecent.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.081
I just know what men desire.

00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:32.583
Watch.
Lucy.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.627
Quincey, darling.
Miss Lucy.

00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:37.630
Why, you're as fresh
as the spring rain.

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:39.716
Oh, thank you.

00:21:40.758 --> 00:21:42.927
Oh, Quincy.

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:46.222
Please let me
touch it.

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:50.268
It's so big.

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:54.814
Little girl.

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:58.151
Oh, my dear,
sweet little girl.

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:00.403
I hold your hand,

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.822
and you've kissed me.
Jack!

00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:07.702
Oceans of love--
Oh, Jack, my darling.

00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:09.495
Oh, poor little baby.

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:11.539
My kitten,
come over here.

00:22:11.706 --> 00:22:13.875
Come over here
and I'll kiss it better.

00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:16.252
My poor little blossom.

00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:19.505
My poor little doctor.
Brilliant doctor.

00:22:19.672 --> 00:22:21.507
Hello, Quincey.
Jack.

00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:23.926
What a naughty bear.
Let me feel your--

00:22:24.093 --> 00:22:27.263
Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.
Arthur!

00:22:28.014 --> 00:22:30.391
Oh, my darling.

00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:32.977
Oh, you look wonderful.

00:22:33.144 --> 00:22:35.938
I'm so sorry
about your hat.

00:22:36.105 --> 00:22:37.940
Absolutely Charming.
It's my snake dress.

00:22:38.107 --> 00:22:39.400
Is it really?

00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:42.278
Lucy is a pure
and virtuous girl,

00:22:42.445 --> 00:22:46.449
but I admit that her free way
of speaking shocks me sometimes.

00:22:46.616 --> 00:22:49.619
Jonathan says it is a defect
of the aristocracy

00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:51.996
that they say what they please.

00:22:52.163 --> 00:22:57.293
The truth is that I admire Lucy, and I'm
not surprised that men flock around her.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.338
I wish I were as pretty
and as adored as she.

00:23:18.439 --> 00:23:21.150
What manner of man is this?

00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:23.778
R.M. Renfield,
successful solicitor

00:23:23.945 --> 00:23:26.364
in the firm of Hawkins
and Thompkins,

00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:29.742
respected member of
the Lord Nugent's Windem Club,

00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:34.288
returns from business
abroad in Transylvania,

00:23:34.455 --> 00:23:37.417
promptly suffers
a complete mental breakdown.

00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:40.837
He's now obsessed
with some blood lust.

00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:46.509
George.

00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:50.805
Wait here.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.065
Would you care for
an hors cf oeuvre, Dr. Seward,

00:24:01.232 --> 00:24:03.901
or a canapé?

00:24:04.068 --> 00:24:07.613
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield.
How are you feeling tonight?

00:24:08.865 --> 00:24:11.367
Far better than you,
my lovesick doctor.

00:24:11.534 --> 00:24:13.369
Is my personal life
of interest to you?

00:24:13.536 --> 00:24:17.415
Of course it is.
All life interests me.

00:24:17.582 --> 00:24:20.460
Your diet, Mr. Renfield,
is disgusting.

00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:24.046
Actually,
they're perfectly nutritious.

00:24:24.213 --> 00:24:27.008
You see,
each life that I ingest

00:24:27.175 --> 00:24:29.385
gives back life to me.

00:24:33.014 --> 00:24:35.850
A fly gives you life?

00:24:36.017 --> 00:24:37.727
Certainly.

00:24:37.894 --> 00:24:41.898
But you might as well ask a man to eat
molecules with a pair of chopsticks

00:24:42.064 --> 00:24:44.817
than to interest me
in a lesser carnivore.

00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:48.529
I shall have to invent a new
classification of lunatic for you.

00:24:49.655 --> 00:24:53.910
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.

00:24:55.495 --> 00:24:57.580
Yes, spiders eat them.

00:24:57.747 --> 00:25:00.082
What about sparrows?

00:25:00.249 --> 00:25:03.586
Oh, yes.
Did you say sparrows?

00:25:03.753 --> 00:25:07.924
Something larger, perhaps?
Oh, yes.

00:25:09.258 --> 00:25:11.385
A kitten.

00:25:11.552 --> 00:25:13.095
I beg you.

00:25:13.262 --> 00:25:16.224
A little, sleek--
A playful kitten.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.685
Something I can teach.
Something I can feed.

00:25:19.852 --> 00:25:21.687
No one would
refuse me a kitten.

00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:24.148
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

00:25:26.317 --> 00:25:27.944
Oh, yes.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.154
A big cat.

00:25:30.321 --> 00:25:33.282
My salvation depends upon it!
Your salvation?

00:25:33.449 --> 00:25:35.451
Yes. I need lives.

00:25:35.618 --> 00:25:38.829
I need lives for the master.
What master?

00:25:41.457 --> 00:25:43.960
The master will come...

00:25:45.044 --> 00:25:48.130
and he has promised
to make me immortal.

00:25:48.297 --> 00:25:49.840
How?

00:25:51.425 --> 00:25:53.135
Get him off me!

00:25:54.554 --> 00:25:56.847
The blood is the life!

00:25:57.932 --> 00:26:00.017
The blood is the life!

00:26:01.769 --> 00:26:04.438
Thirtieth May, Castle Dracula.

00:26:04.605 --> 00:26:08.901
I think strange things which
I dare not confess to my own soul.

00:26:09.068 --> 00:26:10.403
The count,

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:13.990
the way he looked at Mina's
picture fills me with dread,

00:26:14.156 --> 00:26:17.034
as if I have a part to play
in a story that is not known to me.

00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:43.269
I didn't hear you come in.

00:26:46.731 --> 00:26:49.817
Take care how
you out yourself.

00:26:49.984 --> 00:26:53.362
It is more dangerous
than you think.

00:26:59.702 --> 00:27:04.707
A foul bauble
of man's vanity.

00:27:04.874 --> 00:27:07.209
Perhaps you should

00:27:07.376 --> 00:27:09.545
grow a beard.

00:27:17.053 --> 00:27:19.889
The letters I requested.

00:27:20.056 --> 00:27:22.266
Have you written them?

00:27:38.824 --> 00:27:40.326
Good.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.838
Should you leave these rooms,

00:27:54.256 --> 00:27:56.425
you will not, by any chance,

00:27:56.592 --> 00:27:59.887
go to sleep in any other
part of the castle.

00:28:01.597 --> 00:28:03.808
It is old...

00:28:05.017 --> 00:28:07.937
and has many bad memories.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:13.609
Be warned.
I'm sure I understand.

00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:26.205
Do not put your faith
in such trinkets of deceit.

00:28:27.915 --> 00:28:30.668
We are in Transylvania.

00:28:32.128 --> 00:28:35.715
Transylvania is not England.

00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:39.051
Our ways are not your ways.

00:28:39.218 --> 00:28:41.220
And to you,

00:28:41.387 --> 00:28:44.640
there shall be
many strange things.

00:28:44.807 --> 00:28:48.060
I've seen many
strange things already.

00:28:48.227 --> 00:28:51.021
Bloody wolves chasing me
through some blue inferno!

00:28:56.861 --> 00:28:59.655
Listen to them.

00:29:04.034 --> 00:29:07.037
The children of the night.

00:29:08.956 --> 00:29:11.333
What sweet music
they make.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.545
Music? Those animals?

00:29:48.537 --> 00:29:52.917
I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.

00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:56.545
To the firm, to my family
and to my beloved Mina.

00:29:56.712 --> 00:29:59.632
I said nothing of my fears
as he will read them, no doubt.

00:30:05.012 --> 00:30:07.473
I know now that I am a prisoner.

00:31:32.933 --> 00:31:34.643
Jonathan.

00:31:35.936 --> 00:31:38.188
Jonathan, come to me.

00:31:47.907 --> 00:31:49.658
Come.

00:32:08.135 --> 00:32:09.887
Lay down.

00:32:11.221 --> 00:32:13.223
Lay back into my arms.

00:32:22.858 --> 00:32:25.235
Lay back, Jonathan.

00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:30.152
How dare you touch him!
He belongs to me!

00:34:30.736 --> 00:34:32.654
You yourself never loved.

00:34:35.866 --> 00:34:40.496
Yes. I too can love.

00:34:42.664 --> 00:34:46.710
And I shall love again.

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.930
Are we to have nothing tonight?

00:35:42.141 --> 00:35:44.726
Dearest Mina, all is well here.

00:35:44.893 --> 00:35:47.729
The count has insisted
I remain for a month

00:35:47.896 --> 00:35:50.107
to tutor him in English custom.

00:35:50.274 --> 00:35:53.652
I can say no more,
except I love you.

00:35:53.819 --> 00:35:56.488
Ever faithful, Jonathan.

00:35:59.908 --> 00:36:03.579
The letters I have written
have undoubtedly sealed my doom.

00:36:07.499 --> 00:36:11.253
The count's gypsies, fearless
warriors who are loyal to the death

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.630
to whatever nobleman
they serve...

00:36:16.466 --> 00:36:20.095
day and night they toil,
filling boxes with decrepit earth

00:36:20.262 --> 00:36:23.515
from the bowels of the castle.

00:36:24.683 --> 00:36:29.146
They are to be delivered to his newly
acquired Carfax Abbey in London.

00:36:31.231 --> 00:36:35.110
Why do they
fill these boxes with earth?

00:36:40.282 --> 00:36:42.868
I love him! I love him!

00:36:43.327 --> 00:36:45.746
Oh, Mina!

00:36:46.038 --> 00:36:48.916
It's so wonderful.
I've decided.

00:36:49.082 --> 00:36:51.543
I love him
and I've said yes.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:55.130
So finally. Don't tell me.
The Texan with the big knife?

00:36:55.297 --> 00:36:58.133
Oh, no.
To my dear number three.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.262
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
Lord and Lady Holmwood.

00:37:02.429 --> 00:37:05.140
You are to be my maid
of honor. Oh, say yes.

00:37:05.307 --> 00:37:09.561
Mina, what is it? It's the most
exciting day of my life.

00:37:11.146 --> 00:37:13.148
You don't seem to care.

00:37:13.315 --> 00:37:16.401
It's just that I'm so terribly
worried about Jonathan.

00:37:16.568 --> 00:37:18.737
This letter I received is so--

00:37:18.904 --> 00:37:22.324
It's so cold. It's so unnatural.
It's not like him at all.

00:37:23.367 --> 00:37:24.660
Oh, Mina, don't worry.

00:37:52.145 --> 00:37:54.022
Captain's log: the Demeter.

00:37:54.189 --> 00:37:57.401
Twenty-seventh June, 1897.

00:37:59.361 --> 00:38:02.364
We picked up 50 boxes
of experimental earth

00:38:02.531 --> 00:38:04.783
bound for London, England.

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.119
Set sail at noon into a storm

00:38:07.286 --> 00:38:09.788
that seemed
to come out of nowhere,

00:38:09.955 --> 00:38:12.374
carrying us out to sea.

00:38:47.451 --> 00:38:51.079
Third of July.
Second mate has gone missing.

00:38:51.246 --> 00:38:55.667
Nearing Gibraltar.
Storm continues. Crew uneasy.

00:38:56.585 --> 00:38:59.421
Believe someone or something

00:38:59.588 --> 00:39:01.923
is aboard the ship with us.

00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:17.147
Master, I am here!

00:39:18.106 --> 00:39:21.109
The master of all life
is at hand!

00:39:21.276 --> 00:39:23.195
Gather round!

00:39:23.362 --> 00:39:25.781
I am here to do
your bidding, master!

00:39:25.947 --> 00:39:28.283
I have worshipped you
long and far off!

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.912
And now you are near,
master!

00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:34.664
I am your slave!

00:39:34.831 --> 00:39:37.459
I await your command!

00:39:37.626 --> 00:39:40.337
The case of Renfield
grows more interesting.

00:39:40.504 --> 00:39:44.299
Yet, there is method in his madness
with his flies and spiders.

00:39:44.466 --> 00:39:47.636
Had I the secret of even
one such brilliant mind,

00:39:47.803 --> 00:39:51.640
the key to the fancy
of one lunatic...

00:39:57.979 --> 00:39:59.022
Lucy.

00:39:59.606 --> 00:40:01.149
Lucy.

00:40:57.539 --> 00:40:59.916
Lucy? Lucy!

00:41:00.876 --> 00:41:02.002
Lucy!

00:41:08.675 --> 00:41:10.302
Lucy.

00:41:43.543 --> 00:41:44.836
Lucy!

00:42:01.061 --> 00:42:02.229
Lucy!

00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:43.979
No. Do not see me.

00:42:56.408 --> 00:42:57.826
Lucy.

00:42:59.494 --> 00:43:02.581
Oh! I couldn't control myself.

00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:06.543
Hush, Lucy. You're dreaming.
You're walking in your sleep again.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:10.714
My soul, it seemed
to leave my body.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.552
There was this agonizing feeling,
and I couldn't get back to it.

00:43:15.719 --> 00:43:17.137
I'm absolutely shaking.

00:43:17.304 --> 00:43:19.180
It's all right, Lucy.
You were dreaming.

00:43:19.347 --> 00:43:22.559
I had to. It sort of
pulled me and lured me.

00:43:22.726 --> 00:43:25.854
- I had no control.
- It's all right.

00:43:26.021 --> 00:43:28.940
- It had red eyes.
- Hush now.

00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:31.818
I still have the taste
of his blood in my mouth.

00:43:45.749 --> 00:43:48.543
Here we go.
Swing it round here.

00:43:50.545 --> 00:43:52.005
Master.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:56.134
I am here to do your bidding.

00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:00.263
Master! I am here!

00:44:01.765 --> 00:44:04.059
I have worshipped you.

00:44:06.936 --> 00:44:09.773
Contrary to some
beliefs, the vampire,

00:44:09.939 --> 00:44:13.902
like any other night creature,
can move about by day,

00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:18.406
though it is not his natural time,
and his powers are weak.

00:44:35.006 --> 00:44:38.134
See the amazing
cinematograph!

00:44:38.301 --> 00:44:41.262
A wonder of modern civilization!

00:44:41.429 --> 00:44:43.640
The latest sensation!

00:44:43.807 --> 00:44:46.851
The greatest attraction
of the century!

00:44:47.018 --> 00:44:49.771
The new wonder of the world!

00:44:51.731 --> 00:44:54.818
See the amazing cinematograph!

00:45:14.129 --> 00:45:16.047
See me.

00:45:17.882 --> 00:45:19.134
See me now.

00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:29.102
Escaped wolf from zoo
still at large!

00:45:29.269 --> 00:45:31.146
Buy a paper, sir?

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.983
Thank you, sir.

00:45:37.485 --> 00:45:40.989
Get your Gazette!
Penny a paper!

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:56.755
My humblest apologies.

00:45:57.964 --> 00:46:00.842
Forgive my ignorance.

00:46:01.009 --> 00:46:04.012
I am recently arrived
from abroad

00:46:04.179 --> 00:46:07.182
and I do not know your city.

00:46:07.348 --> 00:46:08.683
Is a beautiful lady--?

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:11.186
You may purchase a street atlas
for sixpence. Good day.

00:46:13.897 --> 00:46:16.107
I have offended you.

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:19.903
I am only looking for
the cinematograph.

00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:23.531
I understand it is a wonder
of the civilized world.

00:46:23.698 --> 00:46:27.410
If you seek culture,
then visit a museum.

00:46:27.577 --> 00:46:30.497
London is filled with them.
Excuse me.

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:42.467
A woman so lovely
and intelligent

00:46:42.634 --> 00:46:46.179
should not be walking the streets
of London without her gentleman.

00:46:46.346 --> 00:46:48.556
Do I know you, sir?

00:46:49.808 --> 00:46:52.685
Are you acquainted
with my husband?

00:46:52.852 --> 00:46:54.729
Shall I call the police?

00:46:56.564 --> 00:46:58.733
Husband?

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.319
I shall bother you
no more.

00:47:05.073 --> 00:47:06.658
Sir.

00:47:07.826 --> 00:47:10.411
It is I who have been rude.

00:47:10.578 --> 00:47:13.331
If You're looking“ Please.

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:18.336
Permit me
to introduce myself.

00:47:20.213 --> 00:47:24.425
I am Prince Vlad of Sagite.

00:47:27.428 --> 00:47:29.430
A prince, no less?
I am...

00:47:31.057 --> 00:47:32.976
your servant.

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:37.856
Wilhelmina Murray.

00:47:40.817 --> 00:47:43.444
I am

00:47:43.611 --> 00:47:45.613
honored,

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:47.699
Madam Mina.

00:47:51.661 --> 00:47:53.454
This way.

00:48:06.676 --> 00:48:08.553
Hello, sir.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.973
Mr. Holmwood asked me
to stop by to see Miss Lucy.

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.600
Yes, sir.

00:48:13.766 --> 00:48:16.436
Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy.
Thank you.

00:48:16.603 --> 00:48:18.146
Oh, Jack!

00:48:18.313 --> 00:48:21.566
Brilliant Jack. Do you like it?

00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:25.320
Did Arthur put you
up to this

00:48:25.486 --> 00:48:28.865
or did you want me alone
just once before I'm married?

00:48:29.949 --> 00:48:32.452
Lucy, you're
embarrassing me.

00:48:32.619 --> 00:48:35.330
I'm here as your doctor.

00:48:35.496 --> 00:48:37.665
Your fiancé is very
worried about you,

00:48:37.832 --> 00:48:42.629
and I assure you,
a doctor's confidence is sacred.

00:48:42.795 --> 00:48:44.881
I must have your
complete trust.

00:48:49.552 --> 00:48:51.512
Help me, Jack.

00:48:52.889 --> 00:48:55.600
I don't know
what's happening to me.

00:48:55.767 --> 00:48:57.852
I'm changing.

00:48:58.019 --> 00:48:59.896
I can feel it.

00:49:01.439 --> 00:49:03.316
I can hear everything.

00:49:03.483 --> 00:49:06.486
I hear the servants at the other
end of the house, whispering.

00:49:06.653 --> 00:49:09.906
I hear mice in the attic,
stomping like elephants.

00:49:11.074 --> 00:49:13.743
But I'm having horrible
nightmares, Jack.

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:17.372
The eyes.

00:49:17.538 --> 00:49:18.873
Oh, Jack.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.669
I'm here, Lucy.
Nothing will harm you.

00:49:22.835 --> 00:49:25.546
Ow. Ow.

00:49:25.713 --> 00:49:27.131
Let it work.

00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:31.386
Thank you.
Lucy.

00:49:31.552 --> 00:49:33.930
Oh, Jack, kiss me.

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.896
And may I say, Miss
Lucy is hotter than a June bride

00:49:42.063 --> 00:49:44.399
riding bareback buck naked
in middle of the Sahara.

00:49:44.565 --> 00:49:46.734
I would watch my colonial
tongue if I were you.

00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:52.323
Hello, Jack. And how's
our lovely patient today?

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:56.202
Well, frankly, Arthur,
I'm confounded.

00:49:56.369 --> 00:49:58.997
Oh, Jack, are you
still brooding over Miss Lucy?

00:49:59.163 --> 00:50:02.667
I can only conclude
it must be something mental.

00:50:02.834 --> 00:50:06.254
How very droll.
Did you hear that, Quince?

00:50:06.421 --> 00:50:09.966
Last week he wanted to marry her, and
now he wants to have her committed.

00:50:11.384 --> 00:50:12.802
Let's go and have
a look at her.

00:50:23.563 --> 00:50:26.566
I'm at a loss,
I admit.

00:50:26.733 --> 00:50:29.318
I've taken the liberty of
cabling Abraham Van Helsing,

00:50:29.485 --> 00:50:31.446
the metaphysician,
philosopher.

00:50:31.612 --> 00:50:34.407
Sounds like a goddamn
witch doctor to me, Jack.

00:50:34.574 --> 00:50:38.369
Van Helsing knows more about obscure
diseases than any man in the world.

00:50:38.536 --> 00:50:40.705
He's my teacher
and mentor.

00:50:43.624 --> 00:50:47.128
Do it, man.
Bring him here.

00:50:47.295 --> 00:50:49.255
Spare no expense.

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.708
Astounding.

00:51:25.875 --> 00:51:28.669
There are no limits
to science.

00:51:30.922 --> 00:51:33.174
How can you call this science?

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:37.512
Do you think Madam Curie
would invite such comparisons?

00:51:37.678 --> 00:51:39.347
Really.

00:51:42.266 --> 00:51:45.728
I, ahem-- I shouldn't
have come here.

00:51:45.895 --> 00:51:47.814
I must go.

00:51:53.069 --> 00:51:55.029
Do not fear me.

00:52:10.211 --> 00:52:11.796
Stop this. Stop this.

00:52:11.963 --> 00:52:13.548
Stop this.

00:52:23.891 --> 00:52:26.477
My God. Who are you?

00:52:26.644 --> 00:52:28.312
I know you.

00:52:28.479 --> 00:52:33.025
I have crossed
oceans of time

00:52:33.192 --> 00:52:35.069
to find you.

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:16.194
There is no need to panic.

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:20.031
The animal handlers have
everything under complete control.

00:53:40.092 --> 00:53:42.136
Come here, Mina.

00:54:01.364 --> 00:54:02.990
He likes you.

00:54:29.183 --> 00:54:32.478
There is much to be
learned from beasts.

00:55:45.634 --> 00:55:47.803
The tropical
pampas vampire bat must

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:51.766
consume 10 times its own weight
in fresh blood each day

00:55:52.808 --> 00:55:55.394
or its own blood cells
will die.

00:56:04.528 --> 00:56:06.113
Cute little vermin, ja?

00:56:07.615 --> 00:56:10.159
Blood and the diseases
of the blood,

00:56:10.326 --> 00:56:13.120
such as syphilis,
they concern us here.

00:56:14.205 --> 00:56:16.457
The very name
"venereal diseases,"

00:56:16.624 --> 00:56:20.294
the diseases of Venus,
imputes to them divine origin.

00:56:20.461 --> 00:56:23.839
And they are involved
in that sex problem about which

00:56:24.006 --> 00:56:28.052
the ethics and ideals of Christian
civilization are concerned.

00:56:28.219 --> 00:56:33.224
In fact, civilization and syphilisation
have advanced together.

00:56:36.268 --> 00:56:37.311
What is this?

00:56:37.478 --> 00:56:39.105
It's from the telegraph,
professor.

00:56:39.271 --> 00:56:41.148
Telegraph?

00:56:43.067 --> 00:56:47.488
Mm. Thank you. Gentlemen,
thank you. That will be all.

00:56:58.416 --> 00:57:00.501
Dawn.

00:57:00.668 --> 00:57:03.504
These may be the last words
I write in this journal.

00:57:03.671 --> 00:57:06.298
Dracula has left me
with these women,

00:57:06.465 --> 00:57:08.509
these devils of the pit.

00:57:08.676 --> 00:57:10.845
They drain my blood
to keep me weak,

00:57:11.011 --> 00:57:13.681
barely alive so I cannot escape.

00:57:13.848 --> 00:57:17.184
I will try one last time today
to escape to the water.

00:57:17.351 --> 00:57:20.187
There must be passageway
to the river,

00:57:20.354 --> 00:57:22.773
and then away
from this cursed land

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:26.110
where the devil and his children
still walk with earthly feet.

00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:38.497
For the record, I do attest

00:57:38.664 --> 00:57:41.876
that at this point,
I, Abraham Van Helsing,

00:57:42.042 --> 00:57:45.921
became personally involved
in these strange events.

00:58:39.934 --> 00:58:42.937
Professor Van Helsing,
how good of you to come.

00:58:47.525 --> 00:58:50.903
I always come to my friends
in need when they call me.

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:53.447
So, Jack, tell me
everything about yourcase.

00:58:53.614 --> 00:58:56.492
She has all the usual
physical anemic signs.

00:58:56.659 --> 00:58:59.787
Her blood analyses normal,
and yet it is not.

00:58:59.954 --> 00:59:03.499
She manifests continued blood loss.
I cannot trace the cause.

00:59:03.666 --> 00:59:04.708
Blood loss? How?

00:59:14.969 --> 00:59:16.262
My God, close the doors!

00:59:27.856 --> 00:59:31.193
My God,
she's only a child.

00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:34.280
Ja.

00:59:35.614 --> 00:59:37.533
My God.

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:41.704
There's no time to be lost. There
must be a transfusion atonce.

00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:44.498
Take off your coat. Remember
how to tie a tourniquet, don't you?

00:59:44.665 --> 00:59:47.001
Or have you forgotten?
You perfected a procedure?

00:59:47.167 --> 00:59:49.587
Perfected? No.
I've only experimented.

00:59:49.753 --> 00:59:51.672
Landsteiner's method.

00:59:53.507 --> 00:59:55.676
Animals, goats, sheeps.

00:59:57.344 --> 00:59:59.221
If haemolysis occurs
in the blood-donor serum,

00:59:59.388 --> 01:00:01.056
her red blood cells
will explode.

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:03.559
She will die.
Here, take this tube.

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:09.648
What in God's name
is going on up here?

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:11.358
This is Professor
Van Helsing, Art.

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:13.027
What the hell is he doing to Lucy?

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:14.236
He's trying to save her life.

01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:16.905
Good God!
You're the fiancé? Please.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.825
Please.

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:23.412
Take off your coat. This young
lady's very ill. She's dying.

01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:25.581
She wants blood
and blood she must have.

01:00:25.748 --> 01:00:27.082
Take off your coat.

01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:29.168
Roll up your sleeve, Art.

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:32.838
Oh, God.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

01:00:33.005 --> 01:00:34.548
Roll it up!

01:00:34.715 --> 01:00:36.467
This may hurt a little, Art.

01:00:36.634 --> 01:00:37.926
Ow!

01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:51.732
Forgive me, sir. My life is hers. I would
give my last drop of blood to save her.

01:00:51.899 --> 01:00:53.776
Your last drop?

01:00:53.942 --> 01:00:55.569
Thank you.

01:00:55.736 --> 01:01:00.074
You are very welcome here.
I don't ask as much as that. Not yet.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.659
Hold her hand.

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:18.592
But, Jack, that poor creature has had
the blood of two men put into her already.

01:01:18.759 --> 01:01:22.179
Man alive. Her whole body
couldn't hold that much blood.

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:26.517
What took it out?

01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:28.602
That's a good question, Mr. Morris.

01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:36.110
Those marks
on her throat,

01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:38.654
no disease,
no trituration,

01:01:38.821 --> 01:01:40.656
I am sure the blood loss
occurred there.

01:01:40.823 --> 01:01:42.741
Oh? Where did
the blood go?

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:46.578
You were once
a careful student, Jack.

01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:48.580
Use your brain!
Where did the blood go?

01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:50.124
Tell me!

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:52.710
The bedclothes would
be covered in blood.

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:56.046
Exactly. You do not let your
eyes see nor your ears hear

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:58.465
that which you
cannot account for.

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:02.094
Something just went up there, sucked it
out of her and flew away, I suppose?

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:05.973
Ja. Why not?

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:10.352
That's brilliant.
That's absolutely brilliant.

01:02:10.519 --> 01:02:12.646
Will one of you learned doctors,
or whatever you are,

01:02:12.813 --> 01:02:14.773
kindly tell me what is
going on with my Lucy?

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:18.736
Jack, you are a scientist.

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:22.239
Do you not think there are things in this
universe which you cannot understand

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:24.867
and which are true.
Mesmerism, hypnotism?

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:27.119
You and Charcot
have proved hypnotism.

01:02:27.286 --> 01:02:28.704
Materialization, astral bodies.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:40.424
Professor?

01:02:42.009 --> 01:02:43.260
Where the hell did he go?

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:48.307
You see?

01:02:48.474 --> 01:02:50.851
I feel like a blundering novice.

01:02:51.018 --> 01:02:54.521
Gentlemen, we're not fighting
some disease here.

01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:56.690
Those marks on your dear
Miss Lucy's neck were made

01:02:56.857 --> 01:02:59.026
by something
unspeakable out there.

01:02:59.193 --> 01:03:00.360
Dead, but not dead.

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:03.572
It stalks us for some dread purpose
I do not yet comprehend.

01:03:03.739 --> 01:03:06.825
To live, it feeds
on Lucy's precious blood.

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:09.369
It is a beast, a monster.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:31.183
What is happening
to Lucy and to me?

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:34.520
When I was younger,
my feelings were never troubled.

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:36.980
I wish I were myself again,

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:40.776
the sensible Mina
I always depended on.

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:49.368
Absinthe

01:03:49.535 --> 01:03:51.995
is the aphrodisiac of the self.

01:03:53.831 --> 01:03:56.416
The green fairy

01:03:56.583 --> 01:04:01.296
who lives in the absinthe

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:03.382
wants your soul.

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.594
But...

01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:11.890
you are safe with me.

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:28.949
Tell me, prince,

01:04:29.116 --> 01:04:31.201
tell me of your home.

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:35.998
The most beautiful place

01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:38.083
in all creation.

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:42.796
Yes, it must be.

01:04:46.425 --> 01:04:50.637
A land beyond
a great, vast forest...

01:04:53.307 --> 01:04:55.976
surrounded by
majestic mountains...

01:04:57.811 --> 01:04:59.730
lush vineyards...

01:05:01.732 --> 01:05:06.278
and flowers of such frailty
and beauty

01:05:06.445 --> 01:05:08.822
as to be found nowhere else.

01:05:18.707 --> 01:05:20.584
You've described my home

01:05:20.751 --> 01:05:22.920
as if you had
seen it firsthand.

01:05:27.007 --> 01:05:30.093
It's your voice,
perhaps.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.179
It's so familiar.

01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:36.099
It's like--

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:40.270
It's like a voice in a dream
I cannot place...

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:45.776
and it comforts me.

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:48.403
When I am alone.
When you are alone.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.386
And what
of the princess?

01:06:19.226 --> 01:06:20.727
Princess?

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:22.813
There is always
a princess...

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:27.401
with gowns
flowing white.

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:34.700
And her face.

01:06:34.866 --> 01:06:37.869
Oh, God,

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:39.913
her face...

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:45.252
is a river.

01:06:50.716 --> 01:06:52.509
The princess,

01:06:53.719 --> 01:06:57.097
she's a river
filled with tears of sadness

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:00.517
and heartbreak.

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:06.732
There was a princess.

01:07:10.277 --> 01:07:12.195
Elisabeta.

01:07:14.865 --> 01:07:16.742
She was the most
radiant woman

01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:18.952
in all the empires
of the world.

01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:30.130
Man's deceit took her
from her ancient prince.

01:07:32.299 --> 01:07:35.093
She leapt to her death

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.637
into the river
that you spoke of.

01:07:38.722 --> 01:07:41.641
In my mother's tongue

01:07:43.143 --> 01:07:45.062
it is called...

01:07:46.313 --> 01:07:48.398
argesh.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.402
River princess.

01:09:28.748 --> 01:09:30.125
Dear madam.

01:09:30.292 --> 01:09:33.336
Your fiance' is safe
and in the care...

01:09:33.503 --> 01:09:35.964
of the good sisters
of the Blessed Sacrament.

01:09:37.424 --> 01:09:41.761
Mr. Harker believes your life
is in extreme danger

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:45.265
and he desires with all urgency
that you join him here

01:09:45.432 --> 01:09:48.560
so that you may
immediately be married.

01:09:48.727 --> 01:09:52.230
Yours with all blessings,
Sister Agatha.

01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:57.652
My sweet prince.

01:09:57.819 --> 01:10:00.447
Jonathan must never
know of us.

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:09.581
Lucy? Lucy.

01:10:09.748 --> 01:10:12.834
Abraham Van Helsing.
Dr. Van Helsing.

01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:16.129
And you're Madam Mina,
dear friend to our Lucy, ja?

01:10:16.296 --> 01:10:19.466
How is she, doctor?
She's still very weak.

01:10:19.633 --> 01:10:21.885
She tells me of your
beloved Jonathan Harker

01:10:22.052 --> 01:10:24.137
and your worry for him.

01:10:24.304 --> 01:10:26.473
Well, I, too, worry
for all young lovers.

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:33.605
There are darknesses
in life, my child,

01:10:33.772 --> 01:10:35.815
and there are lights.

01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:38.777
You are one of the lights,
dear Mina,

01:10:38.944 --> 01:10:40.987
the light of all light.

01:10:46.493 --> 01:10:48.203
Go now. See your friend.

01:11:04.678 --> 01:11:06.513
Mina.

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:12.018
You look different, Mina.

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:15.272
You look positively radiant.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:16.856
You heard
from Jonathan.

01:11:17.023 --> 01:11:19.067
Didn't you?
Yes.

01:11:19.234 --> 01:11:20.694
Yes.

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:22.862
He's safe, Lucy.

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:25.699
He's in a convent
in Romania.

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:29.286
He's suffering from
a violent brain fever.

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:31.121
The good sisters
are caring for him.

01:11:31.288 --> 01:11:35.875
They wrote to me,
and they say he needs me,

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:39.045
but I won't go.

01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:41.339
I'm not going
to leave you.

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:43.174
Mina.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.219
You've got to go to him

01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:48.888
and you've got to love him

01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:51.224
and marry him
right then and there.

01:11:52.559 --> 01:11:54.978
And I want you to
take this, my sister.

01:11:55.145 --> 01:11:56.354
No.

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:58.398
It's my wedding gift
to you.

01:11:58.565 --> 01:12:00.025
No, Lucy, no.

01:12:00.525 --> 01:12:02.902
Don't worry about
spoiled little Lucy.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.699
I'll be all right.

01:12:08.325 --> 01:12:10.869
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.552
Jack, how is she?
Quincey.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:48.656
This is why I
cannot breathe!

01:12:48.823 --> 01:12:51.451
Lucy.Lucy.
Lucy, it's medicinal.

01:12:51.618 --> 01:12:53.912
To help you sleep.
To dream better dreams.

01:12:54.079 --> 01:12:57.082
It's garlic!
It's nothing but common garlic!

01:12:57.248 --> 01:13:00.460
Lucy, Quincey's here. Quincey's
here to see you. Get some brandy.

01:13:00.627 --> 01:13:04.297
Now, Miss Lucy,
you just rest easy.

01:13:04.464 --> 01:13:06.299
Arthur sent me
to take care of you.

01:13:07.425 --> 01:13:08.968
He said if you don't
get better right quick,

01:13:09.135 --> 01:13:12.055
I have to put you out of your
misery like a lame horse.

01:13:12.222 --> 01:13:14.140
Quincey.

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:17.477
You're such a beast.

01:13:20.814 --> 01:13:22.732
Will you kiss me,
Quincey?

01:13:25.819 --> 01:13:28.238
Kiss me.

01:13:30.448 --> 01:13:31.491
Kiss me.

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:39.666
- That old coot!
- Get off me!

01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:43.211
Lucy, listen to me!
Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.

01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:48.341
You're at peace.

01:13:48.508 --> 01:13:52.303
Look. There. There.

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:54.180
Ja.

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.225
Nosferatu.

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:13.741
"Here occurs the shocking
and frightening history

01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:17.829
of the wild,
berserk Prince Dracula.

01:14:17.996 --> 01:14:20.206
How he impaled people
and roasted them,

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:21.958
boiled their heads in a kettle,

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:24.377
how he skinned them alive

01:14:24.544 --> 01:14:28.214
and hacked them to pieces
and then drank their blood."

01:14:30.175 --> 01:14:31.759
Ja.

01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:34.846
Dracul.

01:14:35.013 --> 01:14:37.557
For blood is the life.

01:14:52.363 --> 01:14:56.618
My dearest prince,
forgive me.

01:14:56.784 --> 01:15:00.330
I have received word
from my fiance in Romania.

01:15:00.497 --> 01:15:03.625
I am en route to join him.
We are to be married.

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:07.253
I will never see you again.

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.130
Mina.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:21.100
It is odd, but I feel almost

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:23.895
that my strange friend
is with me.

01:15:24.062 --> 01:15:26.898
He speaks to me in my thoughts.

01:15:27.065 --> 01:15:30.109
With him I felt more alive
than ever I had.

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:33.112
And now without him,
soon to be a bride,

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:35.990
I feel confused and lost.

01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:40.161
Perhaps, though I try
to be good, I am bad.

01:15:40.328 --> 01:15:43.289
Perhaps I am a bad,
inconstant woman.

01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:03.768
Winds!

01:16:04.519 --> 01:16:07.188
Winds!

01:16:08.439 --> 01:16:11.651
Winds!

01:16:14.696 --> 01:16:16.823
It is the cause.

01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:19.659
It is the cause of my soul!

01:16:19.826 --> 01:16:21.202
It is Dracula,

01:16:21.369 --> 01:16:23.496
the undead,

01:16:23.663 --> 01:16:26.416
the foe I have pursued
all my life.

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:32.130
Dracula!

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:37.594
Jack, hurry!
I have much to tell you.

01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:42.181
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.

01:16:42.348 --> 01:16:44.767
Do not fail here tonight.

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:47.854
We are dealing with forces
beyond all human experience,

01:16:48.021 --> 01:16:50.023
an enormous power,
so guard her well.

01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:53.818
Otherwise your precious Lucy
will become a bitch of the devil,

01:16:53.985 --> 01:16:55.862
a whore of darkness!

01:16:57.864 --> 01:16:59.365
Well, you're a sick old buzzard.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:02.869
Hear me out, young man.

01:17:03.036 --> 01:17:05.413
Lucy is not a random victim
attacked by mere accident.

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:07.165
Do you understand? No.

01:17:07.332 --> 01:17:11.419
She is a willing recruit, a breathless
follower, a wanton follower.

01:17:11.586 --> 01:17:14.088
I dare say, a devoted disciple.

01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:16.716
She is the devil's concubine!

01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:19.761
Do you understand me?

01:17:20.887 --> 01:17:24.641
Yet, we may still save
her precious soul.

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:28.478
But not on an
empty stomach.

01:17:28.645 --> 01:17:30.855
Jack!
Here, sir.

01:17:31.022 --> 01:17:33.733
Ah! I starve. Feed me.

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:36.361
You old coot!

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:54.540
Your impotent men
with their foolish spells

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:58.836
cannot protect you
from my power.

01:20:11.224 --> 01:20:14.727
I condemn you to living death,

01:20:14.894 --> 01:20:18.022
to eternal hunger

01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:22.443
for living blood.

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:48.321
Pfft! Jack.

01:21:48.905 --> 01:21:50.364
Come here.

01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:55.369
Ja.

01:21:55.995 --> 01:21:59.957
I know how deeply you loved her. That
is why you must trust me and believe.

01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:02.251
Believe?
How can I believe?

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:06.130
I want you to bring me, before
nightfall, a set of post-mortem knives.

01:22:06.297 --> 01:22:08.299
An autopsy? Lucy?

01:22:08.466 --> 01:22:12.011
No, no, no, not exactly. I just want to
cut off her head and take out her heart.

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:15.765
Jack--

01:22:20.019 --> 01:22:22.855
Diary, 17th September.

01:22:23.022 --> 01:22:26.651
Poor Jonathan. Still so ill.

01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:30.029
He's cheered by
the familiar streets of London.

01:22:30.196 --> 01:22:34.367
For me, now that Lucy is dead,
it is a sad homecoming.

01:22:35.493 --> 01:22:38.037
It is as if a part of me
is dead too,

01:22:38.204 --> 01:22:40.998
except for the tiny hope
that lives in me

01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:43.626
that I will again see my prince.

01:22:43.793 --> 01:22:45.670
Is he here?

01:22:45.836 --> 01:22:47.338
Now that I am married,

01:22:47.505 --> 01:22:51.550
I begin to understand the nature
of my feelings for my strange friend

01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:54.136
who is always in my thoughts.

01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:07.233
Jonathan, what is it?

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.276
It is the man himself.

01:23:09.443 --> 01:23:11.612
Look, he's grown young.

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:59.660
Gentlemen, must we desecrate
poor Lucy's grave?

01:23:59.827 --> 01:24:01.746
She died
horribly enough.

01:24:04.457 --> 01:24:07.460
If Miss Lucy is dead, then
no wrong can be done to her.

01:24:07.626 --> 01:24:10.171
But if she's not dead, well...

01:24:10.337 --> 01:24:12.757
What are you saying, man?
That she's been buried alive?

01:24:12.923 --> 01:24:17.928
No. All I say is she is undead.

01:24:18.888 --> 01:24:20.222
Undead.

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:22.183
This is insane.

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:43.621
Gentlemen, shall we?

01:24:43.788 --> 01:24:46.749
One, two, three.

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:05.518
Where is she?

01:25:06.894 --> 01:25:09.063
Where is she?!

01:25:09.939 --> 01:25:12.858
What have you
done with her?

01:25:13.025 --> 01:25:15.152
She lives beyond
the grace of God,

01:25:15.319 --> 01:25:17.488
a wanderer in the
outer darkness.

01:25:17.655 --> 01:25:21.534
She is vampyre,
nosferatu.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:24.662
These creatures do not die
like the bee after the first sting,

01:25:24.829 --> 01:25:27.164
but instead grow strong
and become immortal

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:29.416
once infected
by another nosferatu.

01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:37.842
So, my friends,
we fight not one beast,

01:25:38.008 --> 01:25:41.387
but legions that go on
age after age after age,

01:25:41.554 --> 01:25:43.305
feeding on the blood
of the living.

01:25:49.395 --> 01:25:52.273
Quickly, hide. Now.

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:21.135
Lucy!

01:26:29.268 --> 01:26:32.396
Come to me, Arthur.

01:26:32.563 --> 01:26:35.608
Leave these others
and come to me.

01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:40.613
My arms are hungry for you,
my darling.

01:26:40.779 --> 01:26:44.325
Kiss me and caress me,

01:26:44.491 --> 01:26:46.785
my darling husband, please.

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:49.622
We wave
Christ and His holy blood!

01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:52.416
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:55.711
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

01:26:56.962 --> 01:26:58.464
The power of God
is upon us!

01:26:58.631 --> 01:27:00.633
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

01:27:00.799 --> 01:27:04.470
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:07.139
We are strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:13.562
I bring you from shadow
into light!

01:27:14.939 --> 01:27:16.815
I cast you out,
the prince of darkness,

01:27:16.982 --> 01:27:18.108
into hell!

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:23.614
A moment's courage,
and it is done.

01:27:23.781 --> 01:27:25.658
Take the stake
in your left hand...

01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:30.496
place the point
over the heart.

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:36.919
Then in God's name, strike.
Do it now!

01:27:52.518 --> 01:27:57.523
Eat, feast. You'll need your
strength for the dark days ahead.

01:27:57.856 --> 01:27:59.358
Mina.

01:28:00.693 --> 01:28:03.237
Doctor?
Ja?

01:28:03.404 --> 01:28:04.989
How did Lucy die?

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.285
Well--

01:28:11.161 --> 01:28:12.705
Was she in great pain?

01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:15.499
Ja, she was in great pain.
Then we cut off her head

01:28:15.666 --> 01:28:18.836
and drove a stake through her heart and
burned it and then she found peace.

01:28:19.003 --> 01:28:22.298
Doctor! Please.

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:28.012
So, Mr. Harker,

01:28:28.178 --> 01:28:31.056
I must now ask you,
as your doctor...

01:28:33.934 --> 01:28:35.686
a sensitive question.

01:28:35.853 --> 01:28:38.355
During your infidelity
with those creatures,

01:28:38.522 --> 01:28:40.024
those demonic women,

01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:43.527
did you, for one instant,
taste of their blood?

01:28:44.528 --> 01:28:45.571
No.

01:28:49.908 --> 01:28:53.162
No?
No.

01:28:55.331 --> 01:28:56.373
Good!

01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:59.043
Then you have not infected
your blood with the terrible

01:28:59.209 --> 01:29:01.587
disease that
destroyed poor Lucy.

01:29:10.137 --> 01:29:12.765
Doctor,
you must understand.

01:29:14.433 --> 01:29:16.852
I doubted everything,

01:29:17.019 --> 01:29:18.604
even my mind.

01:29:18.771 --> 01:29:20.814
I was impotent with fear.

01:29:20.981 --> 01:29:23.776
- I know.
- But, sir,

01:29:23.942 --> 01:29:27.696
I know where
the bastard sleeps.

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:31.533
I brought him there,
to Carfax Abbey.

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:37.915
Vampires do exist.

01:29:38.082 --> 01:29:41.126
And this one we fight,
this one we face,

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:43.796
has the strength
of 20 or more people,

01:29:43.962 --> 01:29:45.964
and you can testify for that,
Mr. Harker.

01:29:46.131 --> 01:29:49.218
But he can also control
the meaner things of life,

01:29:49.385 --> 01:29:51.428
the bat, the rodent, the wolf.

01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:55.682
He can appear as mist, as vapor,
as fog and vanish at will.

01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:58.352
Now, all these things
Dracula can do,

01:29:58.519 --> 01:30:00.145
but he is not free.

01:30:00.312 --> 01:30:03.649
He must rest in the sacred earth of
his homeland to gain his evil power.

01:30:03.816 --> 01:30:07.653
It is here that we must find him
and destroy him utterly. Jack.

01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:10.823
I almost feel pity for anything
so hunted as this count.

01:30:10.989 --> 01:30:12.741
How can you pity
such a creature?

01:30:14.993 --> 01:30:16.328
I'll take Mina
to my quarters.

01:30:16.495 --> 01:30:18.956
Good. You'll be safer there.

01:30:21.667 --> 01:30:23.961
Mr. Morris, your
bullets will not harm him.

01:30:24.128 --> 01:30:27.464
He must be beheaded. I suggest
you use your big bowie knife.

01:30:27.631 --> 01:30:30.342
Well, I wasn't planning
on getting that close, doc.

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.345
Master!

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:37.307
Master!

01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:39.393
Master!

01:30:40.352 --> 01:30:42.729
Master!

01:30:44.148 --> 01:30:45.607
Master!

01:30:50.112 --> 01:30:52.322
Dr. Jack!

01:30:52.489 --> 01:30:55.367
I've been promised
eternal life!

01:30:58.036 --> 01:31:00.330
Dr. Seward,
who is that man?

01:31:00.497 --> 01:31:03.000
Mr. Renfield. This is no
place for you, Madam Mina.

01:31:03.167 --> 01:31:06.295
Renfield? I must see him.

01:31:07.463 --> 01:31:10.883
Mr. Renfield,
behave yourself.

01:31:13.302 --> 01:31:15.220
This is Mrs. Harker.

01:31:16.972 --> 01:31:20.726
Good evening.
Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

01:31:20.893 --> 01:31:23.562
It seems I've been
rather naughty.

01:31:26.064 --> 01:31:27.941
I know you.

01:31:28.108 --> 01:31:30.027
You're the bride
my master covets.

01:31:32.571 --> 01:31:35.240
I have a husband.

01:31:35.407 --> 01:31:36.992
I am Mrs. Harker.

01:31:38.285 --> 01:31:41.121
My master tells me
about you.

01:31:42.247 --> 01:31:43.624
What does he tell you?

01:31:44.708 --> 01:31:46.210
That he is coming.

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:50.088
That he is coming for you.

01:31:51.131 --> 01:31:53.175
Oh, please.

01:31:59.264 --> 01:32:01.266
Don't stay here.

01:32:01.683 --> 01:32:06.313
Get away from
these men, please.

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:11.610
And I pray to God I may never
see your sweet face again.

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:17.908
And may the Lord bless
and keep you.

01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:32.798
Master! Master!

01:32:32.965 --> 01:32:35.634
You promised me eternal life,

01:32:36.093 --> 01:32:39.137
but you give it
to the pretty woman!

01:32:39.304 --> 01:32:41.306
Dr. Jack!

01:32:41.473 --> 01:32:43.433
I'm no lunatic man!

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.478
I'm a sane man
fighting for his soul!

01:32:46.645 --> 01:32:50.524
My quarters are spare, but I
think you will find them comfortable.

01:32:50.691 --> 01:32:52.526
Dr. Jack!

01:32:52.693 --> 01:32:55.487
Water and toiletries
at your disposal.

01:32:57.823 --> 01:33:00.242
You'll be completely safe here.

01:34:02.387 --> 01:34:05.891
Destroy every box.
Sterilize the earth inside.

01:34:06.058 --> 01:34:07.934
Leave him no refuge.

01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:10.562
Let the exorcism begin.

01:34:37.339 --> 01:34:39.800
Renfield.

01:34:39.966 --> 01:34:43.011
You have betrayed me.

01:34:44.137 --> 01:34:45.597
No.

01:34:46.973 --> 01:34:48.934
No, master.

01:34:50.435 --> 01:34:52.646
No, I--

01:34:53.146 --> 01:34:55.440
I serve you.

01:34:55.607 --> 01:34:58.443
I serve only you.

01:35:55.876 --> 01:35:59.004
Oh, yes, my love.

01:35:59.171 --> 01:36:01.590
You've found me.

01:36:04.801 --> 01:36:07.179
My most precious life.

01:36:07.345 --> 01:36:10.432
I have wanted this to happen.

01:36:10.599 --> 01:36:12.517
I know that now.

01:36:14.352 --> 01:36:17.814
I want to be with you always.

01:36:17.981 --> 01:36:22.527
You cannot know
what you are saying.

01:36:22.694 --> 01:36:24.654
Yes,

01:36:24.821 --> 01:36:26.907
I do know.

01:36:39.795 --> 01:36:43.840
I feared I would never feel
your touch again.

01:36:44.007 --> 01:36:45.884
I thought you were dead.

01:36:53.058 --> 01:36:57.145
There is no life
in this body.

01:37:01.274 --> 01:37:03.235
But you live.

01:37:04.945 --> 01:37:06.905
You live.

01:37:08.573 --> 01:37:10.492
What are you?

01:37:11.785 --> 01:37:14.913
I must know.
You must tell me.

01:37:22.254 --> 01:37:24.172
lam...

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:27.884
nothing.

01:37:28.051 --> 01:37:29.427
Lifeless.

01:37:31.429 --> 01:37:33.473
Soulless.
What do you mean?

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:36.560
Hated and feared.

01:37:37.769 --> 01:37:40.730
I am dead
to all the world.

01:37:40.897 --> 01:37:42.774
Hear me.

01:37:44.776 --> 01:37:46.820
I am the monster

01:37:46.987 --> 01:37:49.072
that breathing men
would kill.

01:37:50.448 --> 01:37:53.034
I am Dracula.

01:37:59.291 --> 01:38:01.126
No.

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.969
You murdered Lucy!

01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:26.109
I love you.

01:38:27.444 --> 01:38:31.823
Oh, God,
forgive me, I do.

01:38:50.425 --> 01:38:53.053
I want to be
what you are,

01:38:53.219 --> 01:38:54.554
see what you see,

01:38:54.721 --> 01:38:56.640
love what you love.

01:38:58.099 --> 01:39:00.101
Mina...

01:39:00.268 --> 01:39:02.812
to walk with me,

01:39:02.979 --> 01:39:06.191
you must die
to your breathing life

01:39:06.358 --> 01:39:09.486
and be reborn to mine.

01:39:09.653 --> 01:39:12.864
You are my love

01:39:13.031 --> 01:39:15.659
and my life always.

01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:27.921
Then I give you
life eternal...

01:39:29.714 --> 01:39:31.716
everlasting love...

01:39:33.259 --> 01:39:37.055
The power of the storm

01:39:37.222 --> 01:39:40.892
and the beasts of the earth.

01:39:41.059 --> 01:39:43.228
Walk with me

01:39:43.395 --> 01:39:47.065
to be my loving wife forever.

01:39:47.232 --> 01:39:50.026
I will. Yes. Yes.

01:40:18.763 --> 01:40:24.019
Mina, drink and join me

01:40:25.103 --> 01:40:27.564
in eternal life.

01:40:40.869 --> 01:40:42.620
No.

01:40:42.787 --> 01:40:44.247
I cannot let this be.

01:40:45.915 --> 01:40:49.210
Please, I don't care.
Make me yours.

01:40:49.377 --> 01:40:53.423
You will be cursed as I am
to walk in the shadow of death

01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:55.300
for all eternity.

01:40:55.467 --> 01:41:00.221
I love you too much

01:41:00.388 --> 01:41:01.806
to condemn you.

01:41:01.973 --> 01:41:07.103
Then take me away
from all this death.

01:41:53.024 --> 01:41:54.526
Mina!

01:42:04.369 --> 01:42:07.664
You think you can destroy me

01:42:07.831 --> 01:42:10.166
with your idols?

01:42:13.128 --> 01:42:15.755
Sacred blood of Christ!

01:42:15.922 --> 01:42:18.842
I, who served the cross.

01:42:19.008 --> 01:42:21.344
I, who commanded nations

01:42:21.511 --> 01:42:24.514
hundreds of years
before you were born.

01:42:24.681 --> 01:42:26.683
Your armies were defeated.

01:42:26.850 --> 01:42:30.728
You tortured and impaled
thousands of people.

01:42:30.895 --> 01:42:34.065
I was betrayed.

01:42:34.232 --> 01:42:37.152
Look what your God

01:42:37.318 --> 01:42:40.071
has done to me.

01:42:40.238 --> 01:42:43.199
No, your war with God is over.
You must pay for your crimes.

01:42:48.663 --> 01:42:49.914
Christ compels you!

01:42:50.081 --> 01:42:53.585
She is now

01:42:53.751 --> 01:42:57.005
my bride!

01:42:57.172 --> 01:42:58.423
No!

01:42:58.756 --> 01:42:59.841
No!

01:43:01.718 --> 01:43:02.969
More light!

01:43:04.762 --> 01:43:08.099
Light! More light!

01:43:15.773 --> 01:43:17.025
Unclean.

01:43:17.775 --> 01:43:18.902
Unclean.

01:43:20.153 --> 01:43:21.279
- Get them!
- This way!

01:43:21.446 --> 01:43:22.780
- Get them!
- They must be found.

01:43:23.072 --> 01:43:24.115
Unclean.

01:43:24.282 --> 01:43:26.618
We have learned something much.

01:43:26.784 --> 01:43:30.538
Dracula fears us.
He fears time.

01:43:30.705 --> 01:43:33.791
For, if not,
why does he hurry so?

01:43:33.958 --> 01:43:36.711
He is gone.

01:43:36.878 --> 01:43:39.130
How do you know?

01:43:39.297 --> 01:43:42.091
He speaks to me.

01:43:43.176 --> 01:43:45.637
He has a strong
mind connection to you.

01:43:47.722 --> 01:43:50.642
His heart was strong enough
to survive the grave.

01:43:51.935 --> 01:43:55.021
You admire him.
Ja.

01:43:55.188 --> 01:43:59.484
He was, in life,
a most remarkable man,

01:43:59.651 --> 01:44:02.320
and his mind
was great and powerful,

01:44:02.487 --> 01:44:05.448
but greater is the necessity
to stamp him out

01:44:05.615 --> 01:44:07.492
and destroy him utterly.

01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.578
Doctor?
Ja?

01:44:13.623 --> 01:44:17.293
I know that I am
becoming like him.

01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:20.838
Your salvation
is his destruction.

01:44:21.005 --> 01:44:24.717
That is why
I want to hypnotize you.

01:44:24.884 --> 01:44:28.846
I want you to help me find him,
Mina, before it is too late.

01:44:29.013 --> 01:44:32.517
Please help me find him.
Please.

01:44:32.684 --> 01:44:35.061
Look into this light,

01:44:35.228 --> 01:44:37.939
the light of all light,
into this flame.

01:44:39.023 --> 01:44:40.942
Your eyes are heavy.

01:44:42.610 --> 01:44:45.321
You want to sleep.
Sleep now.

01:44:47.907 --> 01:44:48.950
Sleep.

01:44:49.784 --> 01:44:52.120
I must go to him.

01:44:52.287 --> 01:44:54.622
He calls.

01:44:54.789 --> 01:44:56.207
What do you hear?

01:44:58.543 --> 01:45:00.962
What do you hear,
child?

01:45:02.046 --> 01:45:04.674
What do you hear?

01:45:04.841 --> 01:45:08.886
Oh, my prince is calling me.

01:45:09.053 --> 01:45:13.599
He is traveling across icy seas
to his beloved home.

01:45:13.766 --> 01:45:16.894
There he will grow strong again.

01:45:17.061 --> 01:45:20.732
I am coming to him
to partake of his strength.

01:45:26.529 --> 01:45:27.989
We left London by train

01:45:28.156 --> 01:45:31.367
and crossed the English Channel
that night in stormy seas,

01:45:31.534 --> 01:45:34.579
no doubt from the passage
of the count's ship.

01:45:34.746 --> 01:45:39.125
He commands the winds,
but we still have the advantage.

01:45:39.292 --> 01:45:42.920
By train, we can reach the Romanian
port at Varna in three days.

01:45:43.087 --> 01:45:45.757
By ship, it will take him
at least a week.

01:45:47.258 --> 01:45:50.261
From Paris, we traveled
through the Alps to Budapest.

01:45:50.428 --> 01:45:53.014
The count must sail around
the Rock of Gibraltar,

01:45:53.181 --> 01:45:54.932
where we have posted a lookout,

01:45:55.099 --> 01:45:57.852
and then on to the
Black Sea port in Varna,

01:45:58.019 --> 01:46:01.314
where we will meet his ship
and burn it into the sea.

01:46:07.403 --> 01:46:10.531
Home. Home.

01:46:20.291 --> 01:46:23.002
The vampire's baptized her
with his own blood,

01:46:23.169 --> 01:46:25.254
and her blood is dying,
my friend.

01:46:25.421 --> 01:46:27.298
It is no use.

01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:38.434
Mina.

01:46:39.727 --> 01:46:42.980
I will not let you go
into the unknown alone.

01:46:43.147 --> 01:46:47.360
Oh, my poor,
dear Jonathan.

01:46:47.527 --> 01:46:50.238
Oh, what have
I done to you?

01:46:51.948 --> 01:46:55.118
No, no, I have done this
to both of us.

01:46:55.284 --> 01:46:57.495
I can hear him.
He's coming closer.

01:46:57.662 --> 01:46:59.539
He's calling me to him.

01:47:00.415 --> 01:47:03.000
Mina. Mina.

01:47:04.335 --> 01:47:06.712
Stay with me. Please.

01:47:06.879 --> 01:47:08.798
I am so cold.

01:47:21.102 --> 01:47:22.478
All aboard!

01:47:22.645 --> 01:47:26.315
Noon. Holmwood received
a wire from his clerk at Lloyd's.

01:47:26.482 --> 01:47:29.485
The count's ship sailed
past us in the night fog,

01:47:29.652 --> 01:47:31.487
to the northern port of Galatz.

01:47:31.654 --> 01:47:34.824
The black devil
is reading Miner's mind.

01:47:34.991 --> 01:47:37.493
How can we
catch him now?

01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:47.879
Varna. Galatz.

01:47:48.045 --> 01:47:49.714
It's about 200 miles.

01:47:49.881 --> 01:47:52.049
I think that with the horses,
we can cut him off,

01:47:52.216 --> 01:47:54.051
reach him before
he reaches the castle.

01:47:54.218 --> 01:47:57.221
I will dispatch Van Helsing
straight for the Borgo Pass.

01:47:57.388 --> 01:47:58.890
If we fail in our task,

01:47:59.056 --> 01:48:00.933
you will have to finish him.

01:48:05.813 --> 01:48:09.066
From Varna, Mina and
Van Helsing took a carriage,

01:48:09.233 --> 01:48:11.944
and we continued
on the train towards Galatz,

01:48:12.111 --> 01:48:15.907
where we still hoped to intercept
the count before he reaches land.

01:48:16.073 --> 01:48:20.828
I am fearful for Mina.
She is now our decoy.

01:48:33.257 --> 01:48:35.051
I know this place.

01:48:35.218 --> 01:48:37.929
- The end of the world.
- We must go on.

01:48:38.095 --> 01:48:39.931
It is late, child.
We must rest here now.

01:48:40.097 --> 01:48:42.558
No, we must go!
Mina!

01:48:42.725 --> 01:48:44.352
He needs me. We must go!
Mina!

01:48:48.856 --> 01:48:50.733
We are past Bistritza.

01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:53.569
Dracula has outsmarted us again.

01:48:53.736 --> 01:48:57.448
We learned that his gypsies took
charge of the vampire's box at Galatz

01:48:57.615 --> 01:49:00.201
and are now on
the Borgo Pass road.

01:49:17.134 --> 01:49:20.555
Here. You must eat.
I am not hungry.

01:49:24.308 --> 01:49:25.810
Mina?

01:50:12.773 --> 01:50:15.776
You have been so good
to me, professor.

01:50:25.369 --> 01:50:29.206
I know that Lucy harbored
secret desires for you.

01:50:29.373 --> 01:50:31.751
She told me.

01:50:31.917 --> 01:50:34.962
I, too, know
what men desire.

01:50:51.604 --> 01:50:53.481
Will you cut off my head

01:50:53.648 --> 01:50:55.566
and drive a stake
through my heart,

01:50:55.733 --> 01:50:59.070
as you did poor Lucy,
you murdering bastard?

01:51:03.157 --> 01:51:06.619
Not while I live.
I am sworn to protect you.

01:51:21.509 --> 01:51:23.052
No!

01:51:23.386 --> 01:51:25.805
You are safe
within the circle.

01:51:25.971 --> 01:51:29.475
I've lost Lucy.
I'll not lose you to him.

01:51:29.642 --> 01:51:30.976
You're whores of Satan!

01:51:35.272 --> 01:51:37.233
This is holy ground.

01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:39.235
Leave this place now!

01:51:41.237 --> 01:51:43.280
Leave!

01:51:43.948 --> 01:51:46.659
In the name of God,
leave this ground!

01:51:46.826 --> 01:51:48.703
I command you
in the name of Christ!

01:51:53.874 --> 01:51:55.418
No!

01:51:56.836 --> 01:51:58.379
No!

01:52:00.798 --> 01:52:03.718
Christ! Damn you!

01:52:40.838 --> 01:52:42.798
Dracul!

01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:46.802
Dracul!

01:53:19.335 --> 01:53:21.378
Mina.

01:53:21.545 --> 01:53:23.589
You are

01:53:23.756 --> 01:53:26.050
near.

01:53:26.217 --> 01:53:28.135
My love.

01:53:40.231 --> 01:53:41.607
They're racing
against the sunset.

01:53:41.774 --> 01:53:43.651
It may be too late.
God help us.

01:54:15.933 --> 01:54:16.976
Mina.

01:54:25.192 --> 01:54:26.569
Harker, shoot!

01:54:35.327 --> 01:54:37.037
Charge!

01:55:20.247 --> 01:55:22.124
Harker!

01:55:44.521 --> 01:55:45.814
Harker!

01:56:34.071 --> 01:56:35.114
No!

01:56:41.286 --> 01:56:42.371
Mina.

01:57:00.431 --> 01:57:01.473
Quincey!

01:57:05.894 --> 01:57:07.479
No!

01:57:11.775 --> 01:57:13.444
No.

01:57:18.699 --> 01:57:21.326
When my time comes,
will you do the same to me?

01:57:24.496 --> 01:57:25.581
Will you?

01:57:29.418 --> 01:57:30.461
No.

01:57:32.087 --> 01:57:33.505
- Wait.
- No! Let them go.

01:57:33.672 --> 01:57:37.509
Let them go.
Our work is finished here.

01:57:38.302 --> 01:57:39.928
Hers has just begun.

01:57:50.606 --> 01:57:51.648
Quincey.

01:57:58.155 --> 01:58:00.199
Oh, no.

01:58:04.119 --> 01:58:06.830
We've all become
God's madmen.

01:58:09.333 --> 01:58:11.251
All of us.

01:58:20.511 --> 01:58:24.306
Where is my God?

01:58:24.473 --> 01:58:27.684
He has forsaken me.

01:58:33.899 --> 01:58:36.527
It is finished.

01:58:36.693 --> 01:58:38.237
No.

01:58:38.529 --> 01:58:41.156
Oh, my love.

01:58:45.494 --> 01:58:46.829
My love.

01:58:55.170 --> 01:58:57.589
There, in the presence of God,

01:58:57.756 --> 01:59:00.676
I understood at last
how my love could release us all

01:59:00.843 --> 01:59:02.719
from the powers of darkness.

01:59:09.059 --> 01:59:11.645
Our love is stronger than death.

01:59:19.862 --> 01:59:22.739
Give me peace.
