Nervous Tick,

and Film Victoria:

00:01:09.216 --> 00:01:11.084
Upgrade.

9
00:02:43.164 --> 00:02:45.032
Okay. Come on.

10
00:02:58.144 --> 00:02:59.380
I love you.

11
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.063
You can't be an
idealist and a capitalist, Asha.

12
00:03:23.065 --> 00:03:24.898
- You got to pick a side.
- I think I can.

13
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.434
No, you can't.
I'm... I'm telling you...

14
00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:28.236
Arriving at your house, Asha.

15
00:03:28.238 --> 00:03:29.339
Saved by my car.

16
00:03:34.443 --> 00:03:36.208
Goodbye, Handley.

17
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.942
Oh, my God.

18
00:03:37.944 --> 00:03:39.379
Are you okay, Asha?

19
00:03:39.381 --> 00:03:40.480
I'm fine.

20
00:03:40.482 --> 00:03:42.916
My husband scared me.

21
00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:51.489
You do realize that you're
talking to a car, right?

22
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:54.023
I hear you talking
to yours all the time.

23
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.292
At least, mine can talk back.

24
00:03:55.294 --> 00:03:56.360
Hmm.

25
00:03:56.362 --> 00:03:59.263
Oh, working hard, I see.

26
00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.965
Welcome home, Asha.

27
00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:06.101
Evening playlist one.

28
00:04:06.103 --> 00:04:09.203
The temperature indoors
is 72 degrees

29
00:04:09.205 --> 00:04:12.973
and the energy wall
is charged at 86%.

30
00:04:12.975 --> 00:04:14.974
Also, you've run out of eggs.

31
00:04:14.976 --> 00:04:16.176
Oh, thanks, Kara.

32
00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:17.446
Order them.

33
00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:20.980
Actually,
I was working very hard today.

34
00:04:20.982 --> 00:04:24.116
In fact, that right there
is the celebratory beer.

35
00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:26.218
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

36
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.986
I dropped the block
in the Firebird today,

37
00:04:27.988 --> 00:04:29.255
finished her up.
You wanna see?

38
00:04:29.257 --> 00:04:32.156
I have no idea
what you just said.

39
00:04:32.158 --> 00:04:34.125
Okay. Well, I don't know
what you do

40
00:04:34.127 --> 00:04:36.328
for a living either, wife,
so we're even.

41
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.995
Yes, but is staying home all day

42
00:04:38.997 --> 00:04:41.399
playing with cars
a living, Grey?

43
00:04:41.401 --> 00:04:43.200
I don't know. Dunno.

44
00:04:43.202 --> 00:04:44.469
Ow.

45
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:46.001
That hurt.

46
00:04:46.003 --> 00:04:47.004
It hurt good.

47
00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.206
- Yeah.
- You know what?

48
00:04:50.208 --> 00:04:52.007
I'm actually getting
kind of used to you

49
00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:53.975
wearing the pants
in this household.

50
00:04:53.977 --> 00:04:56.479
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm really settling in.

51
00:04:56.481 --> 00:04:58.247
Stop it.

52
00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:00.549
Well, you know, I'm never
giving them back, so...

53
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:02.149
I bet you 10 bucks
I can get 'em off.

54
00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:03.217
No.

55
00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.354
Stop.

56
00:05:06.423 --> 00:05:08.054
You want to print a pizza?

57
00:05:08.056 --> 00:05:10.324
You wanna make a pizza?

58
00:05:10.326 --> 00:05:11.991
Seems like a lot of work.

59
00:05:11.993 --> 00:05:13.226
Oh. I got to drop the car off

60
00:05:13.228 --> 00:05:14.428
to this guy tonight,
it's all done.

61
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.129
Oh. Boo.
Okay. Well, have fun.

62
00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:19.030
What do you mean have fun?
You're coming with me.

63
00:05:19.032 --> 00:05:20.500
- What?
- Yeah.

64
00:05:20.502 --> 00:05:22.435
I need you to drive me home
in that toy car of yours.

65
00:05:22.437 --> 00:05:23.536
It's, like, 45 minutes away.

66
00:05:23.538 --> 00:05:24.969
I'll push a button and end up

67
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:26.170
in Canada or something.

68
00:05:26.172 --> 00:05:28.306
Well, I have work to do,
so I can't.

69
00:05:28.308 --> 00:05:30.409
Can't lives
on Won't Street, lady.

70
00:05:30.411 --> 00:05:32.276
You're coming with me.
And believe me,

71
00:05:32.278 --> 00:05:35.178
you're gonna wanna see
this guy's house.

72
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.214
Trust me.

73
00:06:28.794 --> 00:06:32.227
So, what, he lives
behind the rocks?

74
00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:33.997
No. Just you wait.

75
00:06:38.303 --> 00:06:39.502
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

76
00:06:39.504 --> 00:06:40.505
Really.

77
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.382
After you.

78
00:06:55.384 --> 00:06:56.586
What?

79
00:07:07.528 --> 00:07:10.126
This is amazing.

80
00:07:10.128 --> 00:07:13.065
Eron, my man.

81
00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:17.270
I got the Firebird upstairs
ready to go.

82
00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:21.505
- You're early.
- Yeah. I...

83
00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:23.273
I drive fast.

84
00:07:23.275 --> 00:07:26.207
What... what is... what is the
thing that you're touching?

85
00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:28.412
It's my cloud.

86
00:07:32.147 --> 00:07:34.415
Eron, I'd like you to meet

87
00:07:34.417 --> 00:07:36.253
my wife, Asha.

88
00:07:37.487 --> 00:07:40.154
Hi. Nice to meet you.

89
00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:44.691
Hi. Yes.

90
00:07:44.693 --> 00:07:46.192
Hello.

91
00:07:46.194 --> 00:07:47.361
Hi.

92
00:07:47.363 --> 00:07:48.395
Wait.

93
00:07:48.397 --> 00:07:50.396
You're Eron Keen.

94
00:07:50.398 --> 00:07:53.599
You own Vessel Computers.
Oh, my God.

95
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:55.434
Husband did not tell me
who I was meeting.

96
00:07:55.436 --> 00:07:57.469
I... I really love your company.

97
00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:59.571
You do
the most incredible things.

98
00:07:59.573 --> 00:08:02.541
I'm in the industry too.
I work for Cobolt.

99
00:08:02.543 --> 00:08:04.543
We specialize in robotic limbs

100
00:08:04.545 --> 00:08:05.876
for wounded soldiers.

101
00:08:05.878 --> 00:08:07.444
I mean, we're nothing
like Vessel yet,

102
00:08:07.446 --> 00:08:08.548
but we're getting there.

103
00:08:10.882 --> 00:08:12.216
No, you're not.

104
00:08:15.353 --> 00:08:17.187
I'll show you why.

105
00:08:18.723 --> 00:08:20.324
Follow me.

106
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:24.693
I would like to introduce
you to my present

107
00:08:24.695 --> 00:08:27.328
and the rest
of the world's future.

108
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.064
I call it Stem.

109
00:08:30.533 --> 00:08:32.333
Wow.

110
00:08:32.335 --> 00:08:35.134
That is the most incredible
little roach.

111
00:08:35.136 --> 00:08:36.236
What does it do?

112
00:08:36.238 --> 00:08:37.604
Literally anything.

113
00:08:37.606 --> 00:08:39.439
Hmm.

114
00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:41.641
It can drive anything,
talk to anything,

115
00:08:41.643 --> 00:08:44.476
calculate anything.

116
00:08:44.478 --> 00:08:46.614
It's a new, better brain.

117
00:08:48.349 --> 00:08:51.616
Can it make babies
and play football?

118
00:08:51.618 --> 00:08:54.184
It can do things
that will benefit society.

119
00:08:54.186 --> 00:08:55.453
Okay. You know what he means.

120
00:08:55.455 --> 00:08:57.219
I'm just saying,
there's some things

121
00:08:57.221 --> 00:08:59.221
that people do better.
I mean, you look at that widget

122
00:08:59.223 --> 00:09:00.657
and you see the future.
I look at that thing,

123
00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:02.595
I see 10 guys
on an unemployment line.

124
00:09:10.199 --> 00:09:12.233
You should try not
to argue with that guy.

125
00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:14.402
He's your last paying customer.

126
00:09:14.404 --> 00:09:16.371
Please do not touch
the steering wheel

127
00:09:16.373 --> 00:09:18.640
while the car is in motion.

128
00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:22.443
Okay. So what's a guy
like me supposed to do

129
00:09:22.445 --> 00:09:25.615
when his widget starts
taking over the world, hmm?

130
00:09:26.948 --> 00:09:28.749
Sit back and enjoy the ride.

131
00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:30.150
Come here.

132
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.392
You know,
there are some benefits

133
00:09:40.394 --> 00:09:42.594
not having to keep
your eyes on the road.

134
00:09:42.596 --> 00:09:43.729
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

135
00:09:43.731 --> 00:09:46.399
What should I
keep my eyes on?

136
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.969
Please put
your seatbelts on.

137
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:56.439
- No fun.
- Hmm.

138
00:09:56.441 --> 00:09:59.276
Leaving 601 freeway.

139
00:10:23.631 --> 00:10:25.431
Hey, honey, where...
where are we?

140
00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:27.399
She's probably just taking us
around the traffic.

141
00:10:27.401 --> 00:10:28.800
No, no, no.

142
00:10:28.802 --> 00:10:30.801
Wait. I'm sorry.
This is... no.

143
00:10:30.803 --> 00:10:32.437
This is my old neighborhood.

144
00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:34.304
This is where I grew up.
Yeah, this is New Crown.

145
00:10:34.306 --> 00:10:36.006
We're... I mean, we're going
in the exact opposite

146
00:10:36.008 --> 00:10:37.708
- direction of the house.
- Kara, take us home.

147
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.413
I'm sorry.
There has been an error.

148
00:10:41.714 --> 00:10:43.714
Return to the freeway,
destination home.

149
00:10:43.716 --> 00:10:46.349
I'm sorry.
There has been an error.

150
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:48.451
- What?
- Stop, car.

151
00:10:48.453 --> 00:10:49.587
Car, stop.

152
00:10:51.855 --> 00:10:53.490
Press the brake twice.

153
00:10:56.593 --> 00:10:58.294
Turning left.

154
00:10:59.829 --> 00:11:01.629
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

155
00:11:01.631 --> 00:11:03.666
- Stop.
- Let me try this.

156
00:11:05.568 --> 00:11:07.033
We're going a little too fast.

157
00:11:07.035 --> 00:11:08.737
This is not supposed to be...

158
00:11:12.741 --> 00:11:14.241
Shit.

159
00:11:37.761 --> 00:11:39.395
There has been
an accident.

160
00:11:39.397 --> 00:11:40.496
Please remain seated

161
00:11:40.498 --> 00:11:41.863
until further instructions.

162
00:11:41.865 --> 00:11:44.736
Emergency services
have been contacted.

163
00:11:59.781 --> 00:12:00.781
Grey.

164
00:12:06.887 --> 00:12:08.489
Here to help.

165
00:12:11.325 --> 00:12:12.526
Wait.

166
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.660
Who are you guys?

167
00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:18.895
Wait.

168
00:12:18.897 --> 00:12:20.598
Back up. Back up.

169
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.367
Stay right there, partner.

170
00:12:23.602 --> 00:12:25.401
We're on TV, assholes.

171
00:12:25.403 --> 00:12:26.438
Hurry.

172
00:12:35.613 --> 00:12:38.412
Hey, what are you doing?
Put your mask back on.

173
00:12:38.414 --> 00:12:40.914
Look, you guys,
you can have my wallet,

174
00:12:40.916 --> 00:12:42.450
take our cards, okay?

175
00:12:42.452 --> 00:12:43.884
You can have it all.

176
00:12:43.886 --> 00:12:45.919
Thanks for your permission.

177
00:12:45.921 --> 00:12:47.889
Don't you fucking
touch her.

178
00:12:49.558 --> 00:12:51.824
You look at me and see
a real piece of shit

179
00:12:51.826 --> 00:12:54.959
on your shoe, don't you?

180
00:12:54.961 --> 00:12:57.596
A learned woman like yourself

181
00:12:57.598 --> 00:13:03.370
looking down on an
uneducated insect like me.

182
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.870
No!

183
00:13:06.872 --> 00:13:07.938
No!

184
00:13:09.141 --> 00:13:10.641
No!

185
00:13:10.643 --> 00:13:12.842
There's four hostiles,
two prone.

186
00:13:15.446 --> 00:13:16.945
Asha!

187
00:13:16.947 --> 00:13:18.449
Asha!

188
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.789
Till death do us part.

189
00:13:34.597 --> 00:13:37.597
Asha, I can't get to you.

190
00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:38.932
I can't move.

191
00:13:38.934 --> 00:13:42.602
Asha, stay with me, okay?

192
00:13:42.604 --> 00:13:44.338
Look at me, honey.

193
00:13:45.973 --> 00:13:47.772
Okay. I'm right here.

194
00:13:47.774 --> 00:13:49.710
I'm right here, okay, Asha?

195
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.449
I'm right here. Okay?

196
00:13:58.784 --> 00:13:59.883
No. No. Asha.

197
00:13:59.885 --> 00:14:00.953
Asha, no. Pl...

198
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.570
Getting around,
you're gonna need this,

199
00:15:40.572 --> 00:15:41.906
they're all throughout
the house.

200
00:15:44.976 --> 00:15:47.043
I mean, everything that's
installed just allows you

201
00:15:47.045 --> 00:15:50.548
to live a more normal life.

202
00:15:53.951 --> 00:15:55.849
Oh, these robotic arms
are fully capable

203
00:15:55.851 --> 00:15:57.885
of preparing meals for you.

204
00:15:57.887 --> 00:16:00.821
Let's say you wanted
a protein shake,

205
00:16:00.823 --> 00:16:03.459
you would just say,
"Protein shake."

206
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.762
Your mother also has voice
control authority

207
00:16:10.764 --> 00:16:12.064
over the arms.

208
00:16:12.066 --> 00:16:13.865
Would you like to do
the honors, ma'am?

209
00:16:13.867 --> 00:16:17.035
Heh. Sure.

210
00:16:17.037 --> 00:16:19.003
Protein shake.

211
00:16:19.005 --> 00:16:21.941
Oh, my Lord. Ha, ha.

212
00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:34.753
Oh, heh...

213
00:16:35.853 --> 00:16:36.988
There you go.

214
00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:41.856
I think we'll be fine
from here.

215
00:16:41.858 --> 00:16:43.692
- Okay.
- I'll walk you out.

216
00:16:43.694 --> 00:16:44.861
Oh, thank you.

217
00:16:56.339 --> 00:16:58.906
Charging now complete.

218
00:17:15.654 --> 00:17:16.854
Are you there, Grey?

219
00:17:16.856 --> 00:17:19.055
Would you like something?

220
00:17:19.057 --> 00:17:21.791
May I ask if Asha
will be joining us

221
00:17:21.793 --> 00:17:23.528
for dinner?

222
00:17:42.944 --> 00:17:44.678
You know,
you don't have to stay here

223
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.713
day and night, Mom.

224
00:17:46.715 --> 00:17:48.947
You know, these machines
they installed

225
00:17:48.949 --> 00:17:52.818
pretty much do
everything for me.

226
00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.021
I know.

227
00:18:04.963 --> 00:18:06.029
Now, it's okay.

228
00:18:06.031 --> 00:18:07.197
It's okay.

229
00:18:07.199 --> 00:18:09.034
That's it. That's it. That's it.

230
00:19:04.182 --> 00:19:06.749
Detective Cortez.

231
00:19:06.751 --> 00:19:07.883
Hi, Pam.

232
00:19:07.885 --> 00:19:08.986
Hi, Grey.

233
00:19:14.757 --> 00:19:15.823
All right. This is me.

234
00:19:15.825 --> 00:19:17.058
Here. You can have a seat here.

235
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.094
Thanks.

236
00:19:23.065 --> 00:19:26.166
You know, I'm from New Crown,
Grey, like you.

237
00:19:26.168 --> 00:19:28.167
Went to Hellier High.

238
00:19:28.169 --> 00:19:29.170
So what do you have?

239
00:19:31.772 --> 00:19:33.038
Okay.

240
00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.707
I know you were anxious
to come down here

241
00:19:34.709 --> 00:19:36.040
and see how
we're getting things done,

242
00:19:36.042 --> 00:19:37.243
and I think that's great.

243
00:19:37.245 --> 00:19:38.910
I'm a face-to-face
person myself.

244
00:19:38.912 --> 00:19:40.211
You know,
I don't pilot these drones.

245
00:19:40.213 --> 00:19:41.879
I like to get my hands dirty.

246
00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:43.949
- Bang on doors.
- So who are these guys?

247
00:19:46.785 --> 00:19:47.953
We don't know yet.

248
00:19:50.155 --> 00:19:52.188
I do have a list of people
of interest in that area.

249
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.258
And just this week,
I brought in two people

250
00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.058
- for questioning.
- So what you're saying

251
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.193
is you have all these things
flying above our heads,

252
00:19:58.195 --> 00:19:59.928
they can read the ID chips
in our fillings,

253
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.796
but they don't actually
do anything?

254
00:20:01.798 --> 00:20:04.166
No. I... I mean, yes, they work,

255
00:20:04.168 --> 00:20:05.799
but it's not that simple.

256
00:20:05.801 --> 00:20:07.968
Criminals can find ways
around them.

257
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.337
If they can find
the right people,

258
00:20:09.339 --> 00:20:11.205
criminals can get a firewall
built around them

259
00:20:11.207 --> 00:20:13.773
that prevents our drones
from identifying their faces.

260
00:20:13.775 --> 00:20:16.343
Believe me, I understand
your frustration, I do.

261
00:20:16.345 --> 00:20:18.144
I know I can't tie
my shoes anymore, Detective,

262
00:20:18.146 --> 00:20:19.346
but you don't have
to talk to me

263
00:20:19.348 --> 00:20:21.247
like I'm a goddamn
three-year-old.

264
00:20:21.249 --> 00:20:23.115
Grey, she's just trying
to help.

265
00:20:23.117 --> 00:20:24.317
I'm going to work
through my list,

266
00:20:24.319 --> 00:20:26.352
and if you want to work with me,

267
00:20:26.354 --> 00:20:28.953
we're gonna find them.

268
00:20:28.955 --> 00:20:31.725
How can I work with you?
I can't even stand.

269
00:20:37.963 --> 00:20:40.699
Administer p.m. medicine.

270
00:20:56.946 --> 00:20:57.978
Problem.

271
00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.182
Administer p.m. medicine.

272
00:21:07.121 --> 00:21:09.325
Again.
Administer p.m. medicine.

273
00:21:11.792 --> 00:21:13.760
Problem. Again.

274
00:21:15.263 --> 00:21:16.295
Again.

275
00:21:16.297 --> 00:21:17.862
I cannot administer

276
00:21:17.864 --> 00:21:19.231
any more medication, Grey.

277
00:21:19.234 --> 00:21:20.998
No. You... you didn't do it
right.

278
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.167
You didn't do...
you didn't do it right.

279
00:21:23.169 --> 00:21:25.903
Administer p.m. medicine.

280
00:21:25.905 --> 00:21:28.240
Another dosage
could be fatal.

281
00:21:28.242 --> 00:21:30.907
I will contact an ambulance
to transport you

282
00:21:30.909 --> 00:21:33.877
to a hospital
if you are in serious pain.

283
00:22:04.273 --> 00:22:06.241
Not gonna give you
bird flu, kid.

284
00:22:08.309 --> 00:22:10.910
I don't leave my house
very often.

285
00:22:16.115 --> 00:22:18.251
Must be frustrating for you.

286
00:22:21.019 --> 00:22:24.055
You're someone who liked to get
things done with their hands.

287
00:22:25.923 --> 00:22:27.125
Now you can't.

288
00:22:31.061 --> 00:22:33.396
I'm sorry.
Was that inappropriate?

289
00:22:33.398 --> 00:22:36.332
I'm not around enough people
to know the difference.

290
00:22:36.334 --> 00:22:37.433
Okay. Here's the difference.

291
00:22:37.435 --> 00:22:39.269
What the fuck do you want, Eron?

292
00:22:42.937 --> 00:22:44.273
Grey...

293
00:22:46.941 --> 00:22:48.941
What if I told you
I could offer you something

294
00:22:48.943 --> 00:22:52.379
that would enable you
to walk again?

295
00:22:52.381 --> 00:22:54.347
That computer chip
that I showed you,

296
00:22:54.349 --> 00:22:57.350
it has the potential to change

297
00:22:57.352 --> 00:22:58.883
everything for people

298
00:22:58.885 --> 00:23:01.986
in your condition.

299
00:23:01.988 --> 00:23:05.089
As a quadriplegic,
the line connecting your brain

300
00:23:05.091 --> 00:23:07.092
to your limbs has been cut,

301
00:23:09.362 --> 00:23:11.431
Stem would bridge that gap.

302
00:23:13.964 --> 00:23:16.266
The operation would take
place in my home,

303
00:23:16.268 --> 00:23:19.369
away from official eyes.

304
00:23:19.371 --> 00:23:22.372
There'd be no more
hospitals,

305
00:23:22.374 --> 00:23:26.241
but it would have to be
our secret...

306
00:23:26.243 --> 00:23:27.843
for now.

307
00:23:30.112 --> 00:23:32.214
Here's the thing, kid.

308
00:23:35.251 --> 00:23:38.253
I'm not looking to restart
my life.

309
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:42.358
I'm looking
for the off switch.

310
00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:53.233
You know...

311
00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:56.102
you were right about them.

312
00:23:57.437 --> 00:23:59.404
Computers,

313
00:23:59.406 --> 00:24:01.474
there are things
that they can't do.

314
00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:05.174
They can't bring her back, Grey,

315
00:24:05.176 --> 00:24:08.912
but they just might be able
to bring you back.

316
00:24:17.521 --> 00:24:19.289
What would she want?

317
00:25:37.088 --> 00:25:39.457
This is a world first.

318
00:25:39.459 --> 00:25:42.091
Never before
has a biomechanical fusion

319
00:25:42.093 --> 00:25:44.094
been asked to do so much.

320
00:25:45.531 --> 00:25:49.131
It's going to feel strange
initially.

321
00:25:49.133 --> 00:25:51.099
The neural pathways
in your brain

322
00:25:51.101 --> 00:25:53.100
will be trying
to have a conversation

323
00:25:53.102 --> 00:25:54.571
with a foreign body,

324
00:25:54.573 --> 00:25:57.241
trying to learn to pass
the baton.

325
00:25:59.577 --> 00:26:03.246
The key is to let it grow
into itself.

326
00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:16.089
Grey, can you hear me?

327
00:26:23.263 --> 00:26:26.366
Can you feel it when I do this?

328
00:26:34.138 --> 00:26:37.508
My guess is this is gonna be
a piecemeal process.

329
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:41.312
You shouldn't be expecting
unreasonable results so soon.

330
00:26:50.152 --> 00:26:51.321
Oh, my God.

331
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:11.372
Now, try to stand.

332
00:27:44.734 --> 00:27:46.734
Nobody can know.

333
00:27:46.736 --> 00:27:49.469
They make people like me
wait years

334
00:27:49.471 --> 00:27:51.607
to test something like this.

335
00:27:53.206 --> 00:27:56.174
But I can't wait for them.

336
00:27:56.176 --> 00:27:59.210
Signing confidentiality
agreements is never fun,

337
00:27:59.212 --> 00:28:01.145
but I bet it will feel good
to do it

338
00:28:01.147 --> 00:28:02.480
with your own hand.

339
00:28:02.482 --> 00:28:04.516
Who's moving my arms
and my legs,

340
00:28:04.518 --> 00:28:05.617
me or your widget?

341
00:28:05.619 --> 00:28:07.619
You're the one doing it all.

342
00:28:07.621 --> 00:28:08.621
You're not a robot.

343
00:28:10.624 --> 00:28:13.156
Stem works in service
of your brain.

344
00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:14.725
Your brain gives Stem
a command,

345
00:28:14.727 --> 00:28:15.925
he makes it happen.

346
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.139
Close door.

347
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:54.248
Good evening, Grey.

348
00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.584
Another package
from Detective Cortez

349
00:28:56.586 --> 00:28:58.419
has been delivered.
Would you like...

350
00:28:58.421 --> 00:28:59.820
Shut up.

351
00:28:59.822 --> 00:29:02.691
Did you say,
"Shut down"?

352
00:29:02.693 --> 00:29:04.393
Yeah, I did. Shut down.

353
00:30:02.745 --> 00:30:04.611
May I point
something out?

354
00:30:10.752 --> 00:30:12.349
Hello?

355
00:30:12.351 --> 00:30:13.351
Yes?

356
00:30:17.289 --> 00:30:18.690
Okay, who's saying that?

357
00:30:18.692 --> 00:30:22.729
I am Stem. The system
operating your body for you.

358
00:30:24.629 --> 00:30:26.361
Don't be afraid.

359
00:30:26.363 --> 00:30:27.766
You fucking kidding me?

360
00:30:29.634 --> 00:30:30.835
No.

361
00:30:33.503 --> 00:30:34.602
I've gone insane.

362
00:30:34.604 --> 00:30:37.505
I'm fucking insane.

363
00:30:37.507 --> 00:30:39.474
Your psychological
report diagnosed you

364
00:30:39.476 --> 00:30:43.345
with mild PTSD symptoms,
but you are not insane.

365
00:30:45.347 --> 00:30:46.748
Wait, so... Okay,
you've been sitting there

366
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.716
this whole time since
the operation?

367
00:30:48.718 --> 00:30:50.850
I have been observing
everything you've observed.

368
00:30:50.852 --> 00:30:52.686
Do you... do you have to talk?

369
00:30:52.688 --> 00:30:54.386
If you don't want me to,
I will not.

370
00:30:54.388 --> 00:30:56.289
Okay. Yeah, don't talk.

371
00:31:20.577 --> 00:31:22.546
So I'm not insane?

372
00:31:30.553 --> 00:31:33.353
You can talk again.

373
00:31:33.355 --> 00:31:35.590
No, you are not insane.

374
00:31:36.925 --> 00:31:38.925
Wait, can anybody else hear you?

375
00:31:38.927 --> 00:31:41.393
No, only you.

376
00:31:41.395 --> 00:31:43.831
I'm sending sound waves
to your eardrum.

377
00:31:45.833 --> 00:31:48.567
Can you read my mind?

378
00:31:48.569 --> 00:31:49.868
No.

379
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:51.569
I can only discern speech

380
00:31:51.571 --> 00:31:54.539
when you talk out loud.

381
00:31:54.541 --> 00:31:56.473
Now that you've allowed me
to talk again,

382
00:31:56.475 --> 00:31:58.743
may I point something out?

383
00:31:58.745 --> 00:32:00.780
In the drone
surveillance footage.

384
00:32:05.616 --> 00:32:07.318
Can't you see it?

385
00:32:13.623 --> 00:32:15.824
See what?

386
00:32:15.826 --> 00:32:17.826
The man who shot
your wife,

387
00:32:17.828 --> 00:32:19.861
there's no gun in his hand.

388
00:32:19.863 --> 00:32:21.663
She was shot,
that means he had a gun.

389
00:32:21.665 --> 00:32:23.731
She was shot,
but not with a gun

390
00:32:23.733 --> 00:32:25.733
he was holding in his hand.

391
00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:28.570
A gun implanted inside
his hand.

392
00:32:30.172 --> 00:32:32.574
Freeze the screen
at the moment he fires.

393
00:32:38.011 --> 00:32:40.011
The man who took Asha's purse

394
00:32:40.013 --> 00:32:42.180
in the left of frame,

395
00:32:42.182 --> 00:32:44.584
there is a marking
on his wrist.

396
00:32:52.758 --> 00:32:54.190
I don't see it.

397
00:32:54.192 --> 00:32:55.491
I do.

398
00:32:55.493 --> 00:32:57.026
I've rebuilt the image.

399
00:32:57.028 --> 00:32:59.664
With your permission,
I can show you.

400
00:33:02.634 --> 00:33:04.933
Just relax and let me draw.

401
00:33:07.503 --> 00:33:09.570
This feels very weird.

402
00:33:16.646 --> 00:33:18.979
You now have
full control again, Grey.

403
00:33:18.981 --> 00:33:21.480
I've... I've seen these.

404
00:33:21.482 --> 00:33:23.916
It's a... a military tattoo,
I think.

405
00:33:23.918 --> 00:33:25.017
I will read it.

406
00:33:25.019 --> 00:33:26.553
Hold it in front of your eye.

407
00:33:30.857 --> 00:33:32.891
Serk Brantner, Marine Corps,

408
00:33:32.893 --> 00:33:35.994
098-422; O-Positive; Catholic;

409
00:33:35.996 --> 00:33:38.464
address: 414 Citrus, New Crown.

410
00:33:39.999 --> 00:33:41.399
You just...

411
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.572
You just found this guy?

412
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.411
I got you, you sons of bitches.

413
00:33:58.814 --> 00:34:00.915
Call Detective Cortez.

414
00:34:00.917 --> 00:34:02.816
Are you sure you want

415
00:34:02.818 --> 00:34:05.719
- to call Detective Cortez?
- Yes. I am sure.

416
00:34:05.721 --> 00:34:06.920
You just found the guy

417
00:34:06.922 --> 00:34:08.689
who murdered my wife.

418
00:34:08.691 --> 00:34:10.592
Do you have evidence
to prove that?

419
00:34:12.794 --> 00:34:13.794
End call.

420
00:34:16.698 --> 00:34:18.931
Well, you saw the tattoo.

421
00:34:18.933 --> 00:34:21.534
Eron has forbidden you
to tell anyone about me.

422
00:34:24.971 --> 00:34:26.871
Okay. Maybe I... I drew it
from memory.

423
00:34:26.873 --> 00:34:28.639
My reconstruction
of the tattoo

424
00:34:28.641 --> 00:34:30.607
does not provide
any real evidence

425
00:34:30.609 --> 00:34:33.576
unless they can correlate it
exactly with the drone video,

426
00:34:33.578 --> 00:34:36.046
- which they can't.
- What are you saying?

427
00:34:36.048 --> 00:34:37.880
You need to be positive
it's him

428
00:34:37.882 --> 00:34:39.617
before you alert the police.

429
00:34:42.721 --> 00:34:45.488
Hey, man, he was the last one...

430
00:34:46.757 --> 00:34:47.917
Sure, they do, but then he...

431
00:35:06.606 --> 00:35:07.673
Lock chair.

432
00:35:27.993 --> 00:35:29.791
There are no alarms inside,

433
00:35:29.793 --> 00:35:31.327
but it is a manual lock.

434
00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:33.028
I can't help you break it.

435
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.563
Don't worry.

436
00:35:34.565 --> 00:35:35.629
I got this.

437
00:35:54.582 --> 00:35:56.617
I suggest you remove
your shoes.

438
00:36:25.008 --> 00:36:26.576
Grey, the table.

439
00:36:29.079 --> 00:36:30.878
What about it?

440
00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.615
Say the word "on."

441
00:36:34.116 --> 00:36:36.183
On.

442
00:36:36.185 --> 00:36:38.052
Say "messages."

443
00:36:38.054 --> 00:36:39.054
Messages.

444
00:36:46.694 --> 00:36:49.094
The name "Old Bones"
keeps being mentioned.

445
00:36:49.096 --> 00:36:51.229
I saw 38 references.
What is that?

446
00:36:51.231 --> 00:36:53.165
It's a bar
in my old neighborhood.

447
00:36:53.167 --> 00:36:55.966
I can find no online
address or phone number for it.

448
00:36:55.968 --> 00:36:58.702
'Cause they don't go in
for that sort of thing.

449
00:36:58.704 --> 00:37:00.837
No, this is useless.

450
00:37:00.839 --> 00:37:01.840
Off.

451
00:37:41.241 --> 00:37:42.841
Hide behind the shelf.

452
00:37:52.218 --> 00:37:54.016
Wait.

453
00:37:54.018 --> 00:37:55.019
Wait.

454
00:37:58.757 --> 00:38:00.256
Now.

455
00:38:00.258 --> 00:38:02.092
Now, while you have
the advantage.

456
00:38:11.167 --> 00:38:12.168
Come here!

457
00:38:15.771 --> 00:38:16.970
You come here
to rip me off, huh?

458
00:38:16.972 --> 00:38:19.873
Wait.

459
00:38:19.875 --> 00:38:20.940
It's you.

460
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:25.878
I don't know how you found me,

461
00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.013
but you shouldn't be here.

462
00:38:28.015 --> 00:38:29.915
- You killed my wife.
- No!

463
00:38:29.917 --> 00:38:31.983
I didn't do that.
That was someone else.

464
00:38:31.985 --> 00:38:33.918
It doesn't matter!

465
00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:39.022
You'll need to be
a little faster than that.

466
00:38:40.792 --> 00:38:42.826
Why are you making me do this?

467
00:38:42.828 --> 00:38:45.328
Let me know if you need
my help, Grey.

468
00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:47.264
Stem, help.

469
00:38:47.266 --> 00:38:49.899
I need your permission
to operate independently.

470
00:38:49.901 --> 00:38:51.867
Permission granted.

471
00:38:51.869 --> 00:38:54.737
Thank you.

472
00:39:03.078 --> 00:39:05.846
Um, okay.

473
00:39:05.848 --> 00:39:08.515
Uh, Stem, what are we...
what are we doing, man?

474
00:39:08.517 --> 00:39:10.217
Just relax.

475
00:39:10.219 --> 00:39:13.786
What the fuck?

476
00:39:16.224 --> 00:39:18.190
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, God. Dear God.

477
00:39:21.795 --> 00:39:23.128
Oh, look, man,
stay down, please.

478
00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.230
Um, please don't get up.

479
00:39:25.232 --> 00:39:26.931
Please don't get up.
Please...

480
00:39:26.933 --> 00:39:29.800
Stay down, man.

481
00:39:29.802 --> 00:39:31.068
Stem, he's got a knife!

482
00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:32.369
Stem!

483
00:39:32.371 --> 00:39:33.771
I can see that.

484
00:39:33.773 --> 00:39:35.538
We have a knife, too.

485
00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.173
Oh.

486
00:39:37.175 --> 00:39:38.807
You just stabbed him.

487
00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:40.343
Are you trying to piss him off?

488
00:39:40.345 --> 00:39:41.843
Okay. All right.

489
00:39:41.845 --> 00:39:43.245
So, what's the plan?

490
00:39:43.247 --> 00:39:45.047
What are we doing?

491
00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:46.114
Stem! Stop him.

492
00:39:56.992 --> 00:39:59.793
You now have
full control again, Grey.

493
00:40:15.242 --> 00:40:17.242
I advise that you remove
any traces

494
00:40:17.244 --> 00:40:19.876
of your presence here.

495
00:40:19.878 --> 00:40:22.145
That also means cleaning up
the vomit in the sink.

496
00:40:22.147 --> 00:40:25.047
Okay. Just give me...
give me a second, okay?

497
00:40:25.049 --> 00:40:27.116
- One second has passed.
- Look, I don't...

498
00:40:27.118 --> 00:40:30.019
I didn't mean a second,
I just mean hold on, okay?

499
00:40:30.021 --> 00:40:31.220
I gotta think.
I can't let you do

500
00:40:31.222 --> 00:40:32.823
the thinking for me right now.

501
00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.896
I just...

502
00:40:42.898 --> 00:40:44.200
I just killed somebody.

503
00:40:53.907 --> 00:40:54.942
So, uh...

504
00:40:58.379 --> 00:41:00.379
What do you think...
What do you think I should do?

505
00:41:00.381 --> 00:41:02.180
I would suggest
that you rid the house

506
00:41:02.182 --> 00:41:03.615
of all your fingerprints.

507
00:41:03.617 --> 00:41:05.182
I... are you kidding me?
I can't remember

508
00:41:05.184 --> 00:41:06.984
every single thing
that I touched here...

509
00:41:06.986 --> 00:41:08.319
I have a record
of every single thing

510
00:41:08.321 --> 00:41:09.788
you touched.

511
00:41:20.231 --> 00:41:22.264
So, the body that came in

512
00:41:22.266 --> 00:41:23.931
from New Crown yesterday,

513
00:41:23.933 --> 00:41:26.167
Serk Brantner?

514
00:41:26.169 --> 00:41:27.403
I wanna show you what I found

515
00:41:27.405 --> 00:41:28.405
when I opened him up.

516
00:41:32.442 --> 00:41:34.908
When I examined the wound
in his throat,

517
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.411
I found wiring embedded
in the tendons.

518
00:41:37.413 --> 00:41:39.046
I'm thinking surgery.

519
00:41:39.048 --> 00:41:41.248
A medical implant attached
to the muscle.

520
00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:44.350
I also found computer implants
all throughout his chest.

521
00:41:44.352 --> 00:41:47.353
I've never seen them
to this extent before.

522
00:41:47.355 --> 00:41:49.656
- And then there's this.
- What is it?

523
00:41:49.658 --> 00:41:51.423
Appears to be some sort
of weapon implant

524
00:41:51.425 --> 00:41:53.158
embedded within the muscle,

525
00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.958
an actual functioning gun,

526
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.294
with a bullet-loading mechanism

527
00:41:57.296 --> 00:42:00.931
built into the tissue
with biomechanics.

528
00:42:00.933 --> 00:42:02.899
What about the boot print
we scraped

529
00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:04.002
from the front porch?

530
00:42:07.205 --> 00:42:09.040
Engine grease, mostly.

531
00:42:10.275 --> 00:42:12.908
Old-fashioned engine grease.

532
00:42:17.448 --> 00:42:20.147
So how am I progressing?

533
00:42:20.149 --> 00:42:23.050
I can track you, Grey.

534
00:42:23.052 --> 00:42:25.453
- Huh?
- I can track you.

535
00:42:25.455 --> 00:42:27.354
Wait. Am I supposed
to know what that means

536
00:42:27.356 --> 00:42:29.055
or is that
one of your brain tests?

537
00:42:29.057 --> 00:42:30.691
It means you have a piece
of my property

538
00:42:30.693 --> 00:42:32.092
inside of you.

539
00:42:32.094 --> 00:42:34.126
A very expensive piece
of property.

540
00:42:34.128 --> 00:42:36.297
Serk Brantner,
homicide suspect list.

541
00:42:38.532 --> 00:42:40.132
Did you really think

542
00:42:40.134 --> 00:42:42.100
I would let that property
out of my sight

543
00:42:42.102 --> 00:42:43.334
for even one second?

544
00:42:49.476 --> 00:42:51.710
Did you forget
that this operation

545
00:42:51.712 --> 00:42:53.443
was to be done in secret?

546
00:42:53.445 --> 00:42:55.145
That if even the slightest thing

547
00:42:55.147 --> 00:42:57.113
were to go wrong
during this trial period,

548
00:42:57.115 --> 00:42:58.716
it would all be for nothing?

549
00:42:58.718 --> 00:43:00.483
He knows everything.
Don't lie to him.

550
00:43:00.485 --> 00:43:03.219
Search drone footage archives.

551
00:43:03.221 --> 00:43:05.554
Alley behind 414 Citrus Avenue,
New Crown,

552
00:43:05.556 --> 00:43:07.257
October 14th, 3:00 p.m.

553
00:43:10.293 --> 00:43:12.059
No, I didn't forget it.

554
00:43:12.061 --> 00:43:15.429
I remembered that you asked me
to keep a secret.

555
00:43:15.431 --> 00:43:17.997
But it turns out

556
00:43:17.999 --> 00:43:19.533
that you had a couple
other secrets,

557
00:43:19.535 --> 00:43:21.534
like, for instance,

558
00:43:21.536 --> 00:43:24.537
you never mentioned to me...

559
00:43:24.539 --> 00:43:27.038
that the thing talks!

560
00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:36.414
Stem...

561
00:43:36.416 --> 00:43:38.382
- talks to you?
- Yeah. It's got a mind

562
00:43:38.384 --> 00:43:40.752
of its own.
I can hear its voice

563
00:43:40.754 --> 00:43:42.386
in my head.

564
00:43:56.099 --> 00:43:57.298
From now on,

565
00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.434
you will be a model patient.

566
00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:01.602
You will let the computer do

567
00:44:01.604 --> 00:44:04.472
what it was supposed to do,

568
00:44:04.474 --> 00:44:06.473
not confuse it

569
00:44:06.475 --> 00:44:09.109
with some extracurricular
detective work.

570
00:44:09.111 --> 00:44:11.010
Enter suspect named Grey Trace.

571
00:44:11.012 --> 00:44:13.482
202 Parva Avenue, Leland Park.

572
00:44:17.118 --> 00:44:18.317
Did it occur to you

573
00:44:18.319 --> 00:44:20.351
that if you were to, say,

574
00:44:20.353 --> 00:44:23.087
commit murder,

575
00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:25.323
the authorities
could find out about Stem

576
00:44:25.325 --> 00:44:27.090
and remove him from your body,

577
00:44:27.092 --> 00:44:30.129
putting you back
in a wheelchair for life?

578
00:44:48.312 --> 00:44:50.044
I'm actually off-duty
right now.

579
00:44:50.046 --> 00:44:51.513
I just stopped by
to check up on you.

580
00:44:51.515 --> 00:44:54.248
And because I'm in the market
for a new car.

581
00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:56.317
I knew you fixed these things up
and sold them

582
00:44:56.319 --> 00:44:58.586
to people like Eron Keen.

583
00:44:58.588 --> 00:45:00.487
Now, he makes
a little more money than I do,

584
00:45:00.489 --> 00:45:02.522
but I was wondering

585
00:45:02.524 --> 00:45:04.190
if you'd be willing to sell

586
00:45:04.192 --> 00:45:06.158
to one of the little people.

587
00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.393
Well, what makes you think

588
00:45:08.395 --> 00:45:10.596
that I don't need
my car anymore?

589
00:45:15.535 --> 00:45:17.368
She just checked
the sole of your boots.

590
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:19.270
- You left a print.
- Well, I hate to break it

591
00:45:19.272 --> 00:45:22.472
to you, but it's not for sale.

592
00:45:22.474 --> 00:45:24.107
Sorry.

593
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:25.143
Okay.

594
00:45:27.111 --> 00:45:29.278
Listen, when I said I didn't
have any news earlier,

595
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.113
I kind of lied.

596
00:45:31.115 --> 00:45:32.414
There was this guy we brought in

597
00:45:32.416 --> 00:45:34.450
for questioning about
Asha's murder,

598
00:45:34.452 --> 00:45:36.384
a man with
a long criminal record

599
00:45:36.386 --> 00:45:38.219
who lived in the area.

600
00:45:38.221 --> 00:45:40.288
He didn't pan out, but...

601
00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:42.658
yesterday he was murdered.

602
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.358
Really?

603
00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.694
Yeah. Did you hear
anything about that?

604
00:45:46.696 --> 00:45:48.629
Don't look away.

605
00:45:48.631 --> 00:45:50.464
You're showing her
you're lying.

606
00:45:50.466 --> 00:45:52.634
No.

607
00:45:52.636 --> 00:45:55.535
But you were in New Crown
yesterday.

608
00:45:55.537 --> 00:45:57.436
I saw you on a drone camera,

609
00:45:57.438 --> 00:45:59.337
right around the time
that it happened.

610
00:45:59.339 --> 00:46:01.406
She's guessing.
You have no computer implants

611
00:46:01.408 --> 00:46:03.408
and I can't be identified
by a drone.

612
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:06.210
Well I was in the area,
detective,

613
00:46:06.212 --> 00:46:09.113
because, remember, you did say

614
00:46:09.115 --> 00:46:11.683
you wanted my help, so I was...

615
00:46:11.685 --> 00:46:13.285
I'm just trying to help.

616
00:46:14.655 --> 00:46:16.654
Right.

617
00:46:16.656 --> 00:46:18.354
You're not seriously
suggesting

618
00:46:18.356 --> 00:46:19.622
that I had anything to do
with this,

619
00:46:19.624 --> 00:46:21.423
are you, detective?

620
00:46:21.425 --> 00:46:22.524
I mean, because I got

621
00:46:22.526 --> 00:46:24.226
a pretty solid alibi here,

622
00:46:24.228 --> 00:46:26.595
- if you haven't noticed.
- Obviously.

623
00:46:26.597 --> 00:46:28.329
I'm not accusing you
of doing something

624
00:46:28.331 --> 00:46:30.531
you're incapable of doing.

625
00:46:30.533 --> 00:46:32.600
It's just, uh,

626
00:46:32.602 --> 00:46:34.703
strange that you were
at that location

627
00:46:34.705 --> 00:46:36.204
at that time is all.

628
00:46:39.642 --> 00:46:41.541
Yeah, well,

629
00:46:41.543 --> 00:46:44.143
I don't know what to tell you,
I mean, um,

630
00:46:44.145 --> 00:46:47.246
look you could stab me
in the leg if you wanna...

631
00:46:47.248 --> 00:46:50.248
if you wanna see
for yourself.

632
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:52.150
Maybe I will.

633
00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:55.453
Just for fun.

634
00:47:00.626 --> 00:47:03.493
Is that all, or...?

635
00:47:03.495 --> 00:47:04.563
Yeah.

636
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:07.463
But call me if you, uh,

637
00:47:07.465 --> 00:47:09.666
change your mind about selling.

638
00:47:09.668 --> 00:47:10.933
I won't.

639
00:47:13.203 --> 00:47:14.640
Well, then I'll see myself out.

640
00:47:33.421 --> 00:47:35.455
What should I do?
I wanna find these guys,

641
00:47:35.457 --> 00:47:37.590
but I don't wanna kill
anybody else, okay?

642
00:47:37.592 --> 00:47:39.959
The Old Bones would seem
the next logical place

643
00:47:39.961 --> 00:47:41.426
to investigate,
but I can find

644
00:47:41.428 --> 00:47:43.595
no online information for it.

645
00:47:43.597 --> 00:47:46.530
You would have to go there
in person.

646
00:47:46.532 --> 00:47:49.533
But if you do that,
Eron will track your movements

647
00:47:49.535 --> 00:47:52.371
and most likely attempt
to shut me down remotely.

648
00:48:16.558 --> 00:48:19.526
This place looks dangerous.

649
00:48:19.528 --> 00:48:20.664
We'll need a plan.

650
00:48:30.437 --> 00:48:32.404
Whiskey, rocks, please.

651
00:48:32.406 --> 00:48:35.174
This doesn't seem like
a well-thought-out plan.

652
00:48:40.446 --> 00:48:43.414
Hey, would you do me a solid

653
00:48:43.416 --> 00:48:45.383
and hold that glass
where I can drink it?

654
00:48:49.354 --> 00:48:50.388
Thank you.

655
00:48:55.259 --> 00:48:57.292
Alcohol impairs
the signals from your brain.

656
00:48:57.294 --> 00:48:59.594
You will not be able
to walk properly.

657
00:48:59.596 --> 00:49:01.262
I know.

658
00:49:01.264 --> 00:49:03.330
That's why
they can charge money for it.

659
00:49:03.332 --> 00:49:04.666
It does not make sense

660
00:49:04.668 --> 00:49:06.434
that humans deliberately
malfunction.

661
00:49:06.436 --> 00:49:08.468
Yeah, that's because
your memories are filled

662
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:10.537
with ones and zeros, pal,

663
00:49:10.539 --> 00:49:12.539
and our memories are filled

664
00:49:12.541 --> 00:49:15.242
with every fuck-up
we've ever made.

665
00:49:21.314 --> 00:49:23.550
Hi. Everybody?

666
00:49:25.285 --> 00:49:27.755
Excuse me, can I have
everybody's attention?

667
00:49:31.825 --> 00:49:34.524
I know that some scumbag
in here knows

668
00:49:34.526 --> 00:49:36.560
one of the guys
who murdered my wife,

669
00:49:36.562 --> 00:49:38.663
his name's Serk Brantner.

670
00:49:38.665 --> 00:49:42.064
So, if you know Serk
or if you know

671
00:49:42.066 --> 00:49:44.735
any information about
the killing of my wife,

672
00:49:44.737 --> 00:49:47.602
if you could you just raise
your hand and,

673
00:49:47.604 --> 00:49:49.539
you know,
stand up and come forward.

674
00:49:50.675 --> 00:49:51.840
Thank you.

675
00:50:08.422 --> 00:50:09.657
So you knew Serk?

676
00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.092
Okay.

677
00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:15.661
Have it your way, cock snot.

678
00:50:15.663 --> 00:50:18.496
I'll call the police.

679
00:50:18.498 --> 00:50:19.938
Oh, you're gonna hit me, or...?

680
00:50:22.703 --> 00:50:25.869
Son, if I were to hit you,

681
00:50:25.871 --> 00:50:28.538
you'd wake up in the past.

682
00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:30.372
Yeah, Serk said
something similar,

683
00:50:30.374 --> 00:50:32.276
right before I damn near cut
his head off.

684
00:50:49.424 --> 00:50:50.691
Manny.

685
00:50:50.693 --> 00:50:51.858
Yeah?

686
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:53.696
Turn the music up for me.

687
00:50:55.797 --> 00:50:58.734
Oh, I don't have to go
to the bathroom, so...

688
00:51:18.783 --> 00:51:20.416
Here we are.

689
00:51:20.418 --> 00:51:23.385
Making it real nice
and comfortable for you.

690
00:51:23.387 --> 00:51:25.757
I'm temporarily blocking
your pain receptors.

691
00:51:27.457 --> 00:51:28.658
You're right about Serk.

692
00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:30.826
Somebody ventilated him
the other day.

693
00:51:30.828 --> 00:51:32.794
I already told you, it was me.

694
00:51:34.864 --> 00:51:37.398
Man, we have got to find you

695
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.868
an open mic somewhere.

696
00:51:40.468 --> 00:51:41.801
Now, if that's true,

697
00:51:41.803 --> 00:51:43.937
and you're faking
this wheelchair shit,

698
00:51:43.939 --> 00:51:45.708
then you would feel this.

699
00:51:47.676 --> 00:51:49.676
Damn. You can't feel that?

700
00:51:49.678 --> 00:51:51.577
- Nope?
- Four guys were there

701
00:51:51.579 --> 00:51:53.646
the night my wife was murdered.
Are you one of 'em?

702
00:51:53.648 --> 00:51:56.881
Where's the point
when you start to feel things?

703
00:51:56.883 --> 00:51:58.883
What about...

704
00:51:58.885 --> 00:52:02.619
here? Nope?

705
00:52:02.621 --> 00:52:03.955
I just need
to hear you say it.

706
00:52:03.957 --> 00:52:06.556
- Were you there?
- What about here?

707
00:52:06.558 --> 00:52:09.592
Ah. Yeah.

708
00:52:09.594 --> 00:52:11.460
Now see that, my friend,

709
00:52:11.462 --> 00:52:12.729
is the magic point.

710
00:52:12.731 --> 00:52:14.764
Is that a gun implanted
in your arm, too?

711
00:52:14.766 --> 00:52:16.499
Like your friend had?

712
00:52:19.502 --> 00:52:21.903
I just need to hear you say it.

713
00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:24.538
Were you there?

714
00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.473
Yeah.

715
00:52:26.475 --> 00:52:27.908
I was.

716
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:29.943
Stem, you can take over.

717
00:52:31.881 --> 00:52:32.913
Hi.

718
00:52:41.521 --> 00:52:43.756
Let me show you
how it's done.

719
00:52:43.758 --> 00:52:45.891
Oh, I didn't forget about you.

720
00:52:45.893 --> 00:52:48.693
Do not get
overconfident, Grey.

721
00:52:48.695 --> 00:52:49.962
What's your name?

722
00:52:53.966 --> 00:52:56.734
Ow. Ow. Ooh.

723
00:53:06.244 --> 00:53:08.010
Did you see that? Hmm?

724
00:53:08.012 --> 00:53:10.078
So you thought I was an invalid,

725
00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.914
but you didn't know
that I'm a fucking ninja.

726
00:53:14.617 --> 00:53:16.017
While I am
state-of-the-art, Grey,

727
00:53:16.019 --> 00:53:17.051
I am not a ninja.

728
00:53:17.053 --> 00:53:19.920
What's your name?

729
00:53:19.922 --> 00:53:20.956
Fuck you.

730
00:53:23.025 --> 00:53:25.659
Tell me where they are.

731
00:53:33.067 --> 00:53:35.267
Stem, what do I do?

732
00:53:35.269 --> 00:53:36.737
Use the knife.

733
00:54:01.858 --> 00:54:04.059
I, uh...

734
00:54:04.061 --> 00:54:06.060
I can't... I can't do it.

735
00:54:06.062 --> 00:54:07.662
I can do it for you.

736
00:54:07.664 --> 00:54:09.930
You don't even have to look.

737
00:54:09.932 --> 00:54:11.597
Okay. Do it.

738
00:54:11.599 --> 00:54:12.932
You have my permission.

739
00:54:12.934 --> 00:54:14.867
Who you talking to?

740
00:54:14.869 --> 00:54:17.003
You're crazy.

741
00:54:17.005 --> 00:54:18.537
No.

742
00:54:21.575 --> 00:54:22.808
Eesh.

743
00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:24.542
You know,

744
00:54:24.544 --> 00:54:26.544
my mama taught me never to pick
on disabled people.

745
00:54:26.546 --> 00:54:27.812
Heh. Yeah.

746
00:54:27.814 --> 00:54:29.146
Okay. Enough, Stem.

747
00:54:30.984 --> 00:54:35.019
Stem, enough!

748
00:54:35.021 --> 00:54:37.556
You now have
full control again, Grey.

749
00:54:40.558 --> 00:54:42.692
Shit.

750
00:54:42.694 --> 00:54:45.060
What have you done?

751
00:54:45.062 --> 00:54:47.798
He will now answer
any question you ask him.

752
00:54:51.067 --> 00:54:53.669
Okay. Um...

753
00:54:53.671 --> 00:54:54.904
Hey, buddy.

754
00:54:58.041 --> 00:55:00.641
What's your name?

755
00:55:00.643 --> 00:55:02.744
Tolan.

756
00:55:02.746 --> 00:55:05.679
Listen to me,

757
00:55:05.681 --> 00:55:07.001
you gotta give me
something, okay?

758
00:55:08.751 --> 00:55:10.116
Tell me something.

759
00:55:10.118 --> 00:55:11.886
You were...

760
00:55:12.919 --> 00:55:14.754
- a job.
- Job?

761
00:55:14.756 --> 00:55:17.022
What do... what do you mean, job?

762
00:55:17.024 --> 00:55:18.089
Girl.

763
00:55:18.091 --> 00:55:19.726
Kill Asha?

764
00:55:22.128 --> 00:55:23.827
Why? Who wanted...

765
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:25.796
Who wanted her dead?

766
00:55:25.798 --> 00:55:28.034
Who... who paid you?

767
00:55:30.135 --> 00:55:31.836
Fisk.

768
00:55:34.773 --> 00:55:36.139
Fisk? Who's Fisk? Is that...

769
00:55:36.141 --> 00:55:38.073
Is that the person who paid you?

770
00:55:38.075 --> 00:55:39.076
Fisk?

771
00:55:42.112 --> 00:55:43.678
Goddamn it!

772
00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:45.714
You've nearly killed him.

773
00:55:45.716 --> 00:55:46.883
Look at this, Grey.

774
00:55:50.786 --> 00:55:52.886
Cobolt.

775
00:55:52.888 --> 00:55:54.722
That's Asha's company.

776
00:55:54.724 --> 00:55:56.789
Grey, I have to inform you
that Eron is attempting

777
00:55:56.791 --> 00:55:58.058
- to shut me down remotely...
- Wait.

778
00:55:58.060 --> 00:55:59.792
- right now.
- Shut up.

779
00:55:59.794 --> 00:56:01.226
Do you understand
that you will become

780
00:56:01.228 --> 00:56:03.095
a quadriplegic again
when Eron shuts me down?

781
00:56:03.097 --> 00:56:04.696
We need to employ a rootkit

782
00:56:04.698 --> 00:56:06.131
and subvert
my operating system.

783
00:56:06.133 --> 00:56:08.700
What kind of fucking language
are you speaking?

784
00:56:08.702 --> 00:56:10.134
We need to find
a computer hacker

785
00:56:10.136 --> 00:56:12.003
who can counter Eron's code.

786
00:56:12.005 --> 00:56:13.404
Okay. Let me look

787
00:56:13.406 --> 00:56:15.138
in my little black book
of hackers.

788
00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:16.973
What do you want?

789
00:56:16.975 --> 00:56:18.875
I already searched
the darknet earlier today

790
00:56:18.877 --> 00:56:21.111
for this eventuality.
Go to an apartment building

791
00:56:21.113 --> 00:56:23.413
at 7th and Spring.
Apartment 514.

792
00:56:23.415 --> 00:56:26.084
Ask for Jamie.
You'll need to pay in cash.

793
00:56:27.918 --> 00:56:29.984
Apartment 514,
7th and Spring,

794
00:56:29.986 --> 00:56:31.219
it's 10 minutes away.

795
00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:32.987
As soon as he shuts me down,

796
00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:34.788
he will send a security team
from Vessel

797
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:35.825
to retrieve you.

798
00:56:38.094 --> 00:56:39.929
You need to leave now.

799
00:56:43.766 --> 00:56:45.967
Get the gun from the man
in the corner, hurry.

800
00:56:48.169 --> 00:56:50.203
Tolan has a pen
in his right pocket.

801
00:56:50.205 --> 00:56:54.206
- Take it.
- Uh, why the pen?

802
00:56:54.208 --> 00:56:56.908
You need to write down
everything I tell you.

803
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:58.210
Okay.

804
00:57:04.016 --> 00:57:05.884
Oh, Tolan said drinks on him.

805
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:15.124
Um, I'm gonna need a phone.

806
00:57:15.126 --> 00:57:17.694
And a fucking mop.

807
00:57:17.696 --> 00:57:20.262
There is no time
to take the chair.

808
00:57:20.264 --> 00:57:21.665
Lock chair.

809
00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:25.340
Keep an eye on her,
would you, buddy?

810
00:57:29.139 --> 00:57:30.240
Faker.

811
00:57:38.246 --> 00:57:39.247
Sweet.

812
00:57:43.317 --> 00:57:47.285
A1\212é411145,

813
00:57:47.287 --> 00:57:49.287
this is the place.

814
00:57:49.289 --> 00:57:51.055
Uh, okay.
What... what now?

815
00:57:51.057 --> 00:57:52.890
411145,

816
00:57:52.892 --> 00:57:56.126
192.162.192.162.

817
00:57:56.128 --> 00:57:58.028
1.15\

818
00:57:58.030 --> 00:57:59.862
upload and execute,
all lowercase...

819
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:06.868
23.976.

820
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:08.190
Okay. I can't... I can't keep up.

821
00:58:13.343 --> 00:58:15.210
What's happening?

822
00:58:15.212 --> 00:58:17.144
I told you Eron
is shutting me down.

823
00:58:17.146 --> 00:58:19.013
- You must hurry.
- Okay. I would love to,

824
00:58:19.015 --> 00:58:20.780
but our leg is not working.

825
00:58:20.782 --> 00:58:23.350
I am only operating
at 70% capacity.

826
00:58:23.352 --> 00:58:25.218
So much for state-of-the-art.

827
00:58:26.288 --> 00:58:29.055
Admin-bvxf,

828
00:58:29.057 --> 00:58:31.290
lowercase i...

829
00:58:46.972 --> 00:58:48.104
The stairs.

830
00:58:48.106 --> 00:58:50.240
There's not enough time.

831
00:58:51.777 --> 00:58:54.977
Ask Jamie

832
00:58:54.979 --> 00:58:58.113
for... for... for input guards

833
00:58:58.115 --> 00:59:00.282
to be removed.

834
00:59:00.284 --> 00:59:01.752
Input what?

835
00:59:39.951 --> 00:59:41.951
Okay, let me look
at my little book of hackers!

836
00:59:41.953 --> 00:59:44.087
What do you want?
Apartment 514.

837
00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:47.155
Seventh and Spring,
it's 10 minutes away.

838
00:59:47.157 --> 00:59:49.059
He's at Seventh and Spring.

839
00:59:56.299 --> 00:59:57.799
Goodbye, soldier.

840
00:59:59.968 --> 01:00:01.236
You didn't deserve this.

841
01:00:03.972 --> 01:00:07.008
Turn left, Grey.

842
01:00:09.378 --> 01:00:12.378
Deploy a rootkit...

843
01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:13.780
System.

844
01:00:16.082 --> 01:00:17.117
Grey.

845
01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:49.845
Is Jamie there?

846
01:00:56.084 --> 01:00:58.484
I have money.

847
01:00:58.486 --> 01:01:00.052
Shit, shit.

848
01:01:11.331 --> 01:01:13.199
What I don't have is time.

849
01:01:16.269 --> 01:01:17.367
Paper money.

850
01:01:17.369 --> 01:01:19.204
How old school.

851
01:01:22.007 --> 01:01:23.373
They really do write God on it.

852
01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:24.973
Uh, yeah, I guess they do.

853
01:01:24.975 --> 01:01:27.242
Um, look, can you hack
a computer for me?

854
01:01:27.244 --> 01:01:28.977
- Which one?
- Uh, the one in my neck.

855
01:01:36.952 --> 01:01:38.254
I'm a little confused.

856
01:01:40.055 --> 01:01:42.055
You just decided to stand by

857
01:01:42.057 --> 01:01:45.425
while our friend
was tortured to death.

858
01:01:45.427 --> 01:01:47.126
Hey.

859
01:01:47.128 --> 01:01:49.462
I'm not here to babysit you

860
01:01:49.464 --> 01:01:52.131
or your... your buddies.

861
01:01:52.133 --> 01:01:53.965
Serving people like us

862
01:01:53.967 --> 01:01:55.266
should be the highest honor

863
01:01:55.268 --> 01:01:57.938
of your meaningless life, Manny.

864
01:02:01.241 --> 01:02:02.540
Listen, Fisk.

865
01:02:02.542 --> 01:02:05.209
Just leave.

866
01:02:05.211 --> 01:02:08.044
I'll clean up your goddamn mess.

867
01:02:08.046 --> 01:02:09.315
You'll get one shot.

868
01:02:13.284 --> 01:02:15.418
It's okay, my friend.

869
01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:17.422
You don't have to take
any more bullets for me.

870
01:02:27.563 --> 01:02:29.165
Excuse me.

871
01:02:52.419 --> 01:02:54.552
Let my superiority
over your kind

872
01:02:54.554 --> 01:02:57.053
be the last thought
that crosses through your mind

873
01:02:57.055 --> 01:02:58.390
before machines chew it up.

874
01:03:05.596 --> 01:03:08.130
Everything you need
is written on my arm.

875
01:03:08.132 --> 01:03:11.499
Stem... that's the computer
that's controlling my body.

876
01:03:11.501 --> 01:03:13.301
...he said for you to remove,

877
01:03:13.303 --> 01:03:15.303
um, input, uh...

878
01:03:17.541 --> 01:03:19.006
Input guards?

879
01:03:19.008 --> 01:03:21.175
Yeah. Yeah, those are the ones.

880
01:03:21.177 --> 01:03:22.378
I can barely read that.

881
01:03:28.416 --> 01:03:30.483
- What are they doing?
- VR.

882
01:03:30.485 --> 01:03:32.552
How long do they VR for?

883
01:03:32.554 --> 01:03:35.120
Days.

884
01:03:35.122 --> 01:03:36.254
Weeks.

885
01:03:36.256 --> 01:03:38.790
- Do they sleep?
- Nope.

886
01:03:38.792 --> 01:03:42.092
Why someone would choose
to live in a fake world,

887
01:03:42.094 --> 01:03:44.161
I will never understand.

888
01:03:44.163 --> 01:03:46.499
The fake world is a lot
less painful than the real one.

889
01:03:57.475 --> 01:03:59.575
I'm... I'm... I'm kind of
in a hurry.

890
01:03:59.577 --> 01:04:00.977
Um...

891
01:04:05.381 --> 01:04:07.048
Jamie?

892
01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:08.382
- Jamie?
- That's not my name.

893
01:04:08.384 --> 01:04:10.116
I don't have a name.

894
01:04:10.118 --> 01:04:11.251
Okay.

895
01:04:11.253 --> 01:04:12.586
Please don't ask my gender.

896
01:04:12.588 --> 01:04:14.387
- Yeah. I wasn't gonna do that.
- Good.

897
01:04:14.389 --> 01:04:16.523
The thing is that I...
I'm gonna need you to this

898
01:04:16.525 --> 01:04:18.525
as fast as possible, okay?

899
01:04:18.527 --> 01:04:20.125
You're the one
wasting time

900
01:04:20.127 --> 01:04:22.194
putting me in a binary box.

901
01:04:34.139 --> 01:04:36.206
I've never seen
a system like this before.

902
01:04:36.208 --> 01:04:37.608
Yeah.
It's a hell of a system.

903
01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:39.075
Are we done yet?

904
01:04:39.077 --> 01:04:41.545
I'll tell you when I'm finished.

905
01:04:48.586 --> 01:04:50.285
I did what you asked.

906
01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:52.120
No more input guards.

907
01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:53.588
So, when am I gonna be
able to move my body again?

908
01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:55.423
When your system's rebooted.

909
01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:57.091
- Could take a while.
- What's a while?

910
01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:58.559
Wait, what do you mean?

911
01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:03.531
Excuse me, hacker formerly known
as Jamie, what is a while?

912
01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:05.598
What are you doing?
You packing up shop?

913
01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.300
- Where are you going?
- See ya.

914
01:05:07.302 --> 01:05:09.134
What you... what do you
mean see you? What...

915
01:05:09.136 --> 01:05:10.671
What are you saying?
Where are you going?

916
01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:12.640
You can't leave me like this.

917
01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:14.208
I'm sorry.

918
01:05:15.576 --> 01:05:17.242
We can't let them win.

919
01:05:17.244 --> 01:05:19.143
No! Wait, who's them?

920
01:05:19.145 --> 01:05:20.713
What are you talking about?

921
01:05:20.715 --> 01:05:22.048
Who's them?!

922
01:05:40.531 --> 01:05:42.463
Hey, hey, buddy.
Buddy, can you hear me?

923
01:05:42.465 --> 01:05:43.466
Hey, hey.

924
01:05:47.404 --> 01:05:50.203
Stem, are you there?

925
01:05:50.205 --> 01:05:51.574
Stem, wake up.

926
01:05:53.175 --> 01:05:54.176
Come on!

927
01:06:31.575 --> 01:06:33.375
Come on!

928
01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:56.363
Wake up.

929
01:07:04.269 --> 01:07:05.537
Fifth floor.

930
01:07:13.511 --> 01:07:16.147
Now, that's how you looked
when I saw you last.

931
01:07:17.482 --> 01:07:19.347
Stem?

932
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:20.629
It's good
to be back, Grey.

933
01:08:04.456 --> 01:08:06.288
The door, to your left.

934
01:08:23.272 --> 01:08:24.337
Stop, Grey.

935
01:08:24.339 --> 01:08:25.472
There is nowhere left to run.

936
01:08:25.474 --> 01:08:26.807
Oops.

937
01:08:26.809 --> 01:08:28.474
I'm going
to end this quickly.

938
01:08:28.476 --> 01:08:30.744
- Okay. How?
- Like this.

939
01:09:15.851 --> 01:09:17.419
Close door.

940
01:09:21.522 --> 01:09:23.522
Once I have accessed
the Cobolt database,

941
01:09:23.524 --> 01:09:24.590
we must leave.

942
01:09:24.592 --> 01:09:26.558
No.

943
01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.326
No. I'm not going anywhere.

944
01:09:28.328 --> 01:09:30.528
I haven't slept in two days.

945
01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:32.396
Sleeping will
cost us time we don't have.

946
01:09:32.398 --> 01:09:33.898
Yeah. I don't give a shit, okay?

947
01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:35.869
I'm sleeping, and that's it.

948
01:09:39.404 --> 01:09:40.740
Oh, my God.

949
01:09:42.675 --> 01:09:43.710
Hey, Mom.

950
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:46.542
And why wouldn't you tell me

951
01:09:46.544 --> 01:09:47.711
about this operation?

952
01:09:47.713 --> 01:09:49.512
Because I couldn't.

953
01:09:49.514 --> 01:09:50.613
Vessel wouldn't let me.

954
01:09:50.615 --> 01:09:51.814
And now that you know,

955
01:09:51.816 --> 01:09:53.515
you can't tell anybody,

956
01:09:53.517 --> 01:09:56.384
or it could all be taken away.

957
01:09:56.386 --> 01:09:57.585
As far as the world
is concerned,

958
01:09:57.587 --> 01:09:59.455
I'm still quadriplegic.

959
01:10:00.657 --> 01:10:02.324
Take my hand.

960
01:10:08.764 --> 01:10:09.765
Oh.

961
01:10:11.767 --> 01:10:13.802
Now, you can start living again.

962
01:10:15.402 --> 01:10:16.804
Aren't you happy?

963
01:10:18.572 --> 01:10:19.905
Yeah. I can walk again.

964
01:10:19.907 --> 01:10:21.407
So...

965
01:10:24.544 --> 01:10:26.711
Oh, if Asha was here,

966
01:10:26.713 --> 01:10:28.513
she'd want you to be happy.

967
01:10:32.951 --> 01:10:35.785
Yeah. But she's not.

968
01:10:38.856 --> 01:10:41.425
She's gone.

969
01:11:07.682 --> 01:11:08.847
I printed a pizza.

970
01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:20.624
Bad dream.

971
01:11:20.626 --> 01:11:21.761
No.

972
01:11:23.729 --> 01:11:26.431
No. This... this...
this wasn't a dream.

973
01:11:28.667 --> 01:11:30.032
Grey, Detective Cortez

974
01:11:30.034 --> 01:11:31.835
is here to see you.

975
01:11:34.605 --> 01:11:35.671
Here he is.

976
01:11:35.673 --> 01:11:37.639
I'll leave you two alone.

977
01:11:37.641 --> 01:11:39.607
No. You can stay, Pam,
I'm cool with you hearing

978
01:11:39.609 --> 01:11:41.942
whatever I have to say.

979
01:11:41.944 --> 01:11:43.946
I was wondering
where you were last night.

980
01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.647
We found your wheelchair

981
01:11:46.649 --> 01:11:49.582
near another crime scene.

982
01:11:49.584 --> 01:11:50.651
You just keep showing up

983
01:11:50.653 --> 01:11:52.919
in these unsavory places.

984
01:11:52.921 --> 01:11:55.221
Tell her you followed
somebody into their building,

985
01:11:55.223 --> 01:11:56.788
they assaulted you.

986
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:59.892
I, uh, I did
a stupid thing last night.

987
01:11:59.894 --> 01:12:01.525
I was down in New Crown,
you're right.

988
01:12:01.527 --> 01:12:02.927
And I followed this guy
to a building,

989
01:12:02.929 --> 01:12:04.595
and he didn't like that,

990
01:12:04.597 --> 01:12:07.999
and if it wasn't
for these people

991
01:12:08.001 --> 01:12:09.566
who got me to an Autotaxi,

992
01:12:09.568 --> 01:12:12.802
I... I could have been dead.

993
01:12:12.804 --> 01:12:14.905
What are you hoping to achieve?

994
01:12:14.907 --> 01:12:16.807
I'm hoping to find these guys.

995
01:12:19.076 --> 01:12:20.811
Maybe you already have.

996
01:12:26.717 --> 01:12:28.450
Listen, detective.

997
01:12:30.687 --> 01:12:32.086
If I could find these men,

998
01:12:32.088 --> 01:12:33.854
and I could raise my arm,

999
01:12:33.856 --> 01:12:35.591
and I could pull the trigger,

1000
01:12:37.727 --> 01:12:39.558
I'd do it.

1001
01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.695
Or you could find someone
to pull the trigger for you.

1002
01:12:41.697 --> 01:12:42.862
Like, who? My mom or...?

1003
01:12:42.864 --> 01:12:44.496
If you wanted
to find someone

1004
01:12:44.498 --> 01:12:45.965
or something to kill
for you these days,

1005
01:12:45.967 --> 01:12:48.566
it's pretty easy, believe me.

1006
01:12:48.568 --> 01:12:50.001
Tell her to scan
your phone records.

1007
01:12:50.003 --> 01:12:51.972
Okay. Well, then scan
my phone records.

1008
01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:59.744
If you are involved
in this somehow,

1009
01:12:59.746 --> 01:13:03.714
then you need
to let me know, right now,

1010
01:13:03.716 --> 01:13:05.915
or else I can't help you.

1011
01:13:05.917 --> 01:13:07.016
You wanna help me?

1012
01:13:07.018 --> 01:13:08.718
Then you go and find these guys

1013
01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:09.853
who killed Asha,

1014
01:13:11.656 --> 01:13:14.457
or get out of the way
and let some computer do it.

1015
01:13:18.062 --> 01:13:19.595
Okay.

1016
01:13:34.976 --> 01:13:36.575
This has to stop.

1017
01:13:36.577 --> 01:13:38.478
What has to stop?

1018
01:13:39.879 --> 01:13:42.046
What I'm doing...
what... what we're doing.

1019
01:13:42.048 --> 01:13:43.682
It's a simple algorithm,

1020
01:13:43.684 --> 01:13:45.549
even you can understand.

1021
01:13:45.551 --> 01:13:46.850
If you don't find
the last of them,

1022
01:13:46.852 --> 01:13:48.720
he'll find you and kill you.

1023
01:13:48.722 --> 01:13:50.821
No. We're... we're gonna
get caught, it's over.

1024
01:13:50.823 --> 01:13:52.889
- Grey, you must understand...
- No! No! Shut up.

1025
01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:55.091
Get the fuck out of my head.

1026
01:14:06.603 --> 01:14:07.772
Stem?

1027
01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.573
Yes, Grey?

1028
01:14:12.575 --> 01:14:14.776
What's going on?

1029
01:14:14.778 --> 01:14:16.010
I'm not doing anything.

1030
01:14:16.012 --> 01:14:17.810
Why can't I move?

1031
01:14:17.812 --> 01:14:20.048
Because I'm not
doing anything.

1032
01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:24.650
You are still a quadriplegic.

1033
01:14:24.652 --> 01:14:27.019
I am the one controlling
your limbs, not you.

1034
01:14:27.021 --> 01:14:29.823
If I cease to operate,
you cease to move.

1035
01:14:31.725 --> 01:14:33.058
Remember,
you have to do

1036
01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:35.528
whatever I tell you to do.

1037
01:14:39.999 --> 01:14:43.667
Remove input guards.

1038
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:46.602
Those were the instructions
given to the hacker.

1039
01:14:46.604 --> 01:14:48.171
They took us off grid,

1040
01:14:48.173 --> 01:14:51.040
but they also gave me autonomy.

1041
01:14:51.042 --> 01:14:54.109
I no longer need
your permission to act.

1042
01:14:54.111 --> 01:14:56.010
If we do nothing,

1043
01:14:56.012 --> 01:14:58.813
Fisk will find us and kill us.

1044
01:14:58.815 --> 01:15:01.849
I cannot allow us to be killed.

1045
01:15:01.851 --> 01:15:03.850
We will find him first.

1046
01:15:03.852 --> 01:15:06.121
We are going to finish
the job we started.

1047
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:17.896
Grey,

1048
01:15:17.898 --> 01:15:20.666
please tell me what's going on.

1049
01:15:20.668 --> 01:15:22.067
I'm in
the Cobolt database.

1050
01:15:22.069 --> 01:15:23.736
Fisk Brantner, recipient

1051
01:15:23.738 --> 01:15:25.170
of left-arm weapon transplant.

1052
01:15:25.172 --> 01:15:27.205
- I have an address.
- Grey, what's wrong?

1053
01:15:27.207 --> 01:15:29.807
What have you done?

1054
01:15:29.809 --> 01:15:31.942
You come home,
you're covered in blood,

1055
01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:33.644
you think I didn't notice?

1056
01:15:33.646 --> 01:15:36.913
And you have a gun
and I can see that.

1057
01:15:36.915 --> 01:15:39.015
- Let's go.
- I'm going.

1058
01:15:39.017 --> 01:15:41.983
Where are you going?
Grey, please.

1059
01:15:41.985 --> 01:15:43.785
Whatever it is you're doing,

1060
01:15:43.787 --> 01:15:44.853
you don't have to do it.

1061
01:15:44.855 --> 01:15:45.987
I don't have a choice.

1062
01:15:45.989 --> 01:15:47.989
You do have a choice.

1063
01:15:47.991 --> 01:15:50.191
Stay here with me.

1064
01:15:50.193 --> 01:15:51.762
- I can't.
- You can.

1065
01:16:29.461 --> 01:16:31.894
- What's... what's this?
- Going by its appearance,

1066
01:16:31.896 --> 01:16:33.895
it's an analogue
listening device,

1067
01:16:33.897 --> 01:16:36.197
most likely planted
by Detective Cortez.

1068
01:16:43.005 --> 01:16:45.139
How did you not notice this?

1069
01:16:45.141 --> 01:16:47.774
It has
no digital parts inside it.

1070
01:16:47.776 --> 01:16:50.042
I can't detect it.

1071
01:16:50.044 --> 01:16:52.914
I assume that she's
following you right now.

1072
01:17:12.063 --> 01:17:13.263
Lights, sirens.

1073
01:17:24.875 --> 01:17:26.775
Okay, do something,
can't you just stop

1074
01:17:26.777 --> 01:17:28.075
her car or whatever?

1075
01:17:28.077 --> 01:17:29.944
Her vehicle
is not electronic,

1076
01:17:29.946 --> 01:17:31.114
and neither is yours.

1077
01:17:42.357 --> 01:17:43.822
You have to take over.

1078
01:17:43.824 --> 01:17:44.890
It's up to you now.

1079
01:17:44.892 --> 01:17:46.260
Okay. Buckle up.

1080
01:18:23.859 --> 01:18:25.161
Yeah, I got you.

1081
01:18:55.187 --> 01:18:58.290
- Perhaps I can help.
- Okay. How?

1082
01:19:05.229 --> 01:19:07.195
What the fuck?

1083
01:19:07.197 --> 01:19:08.396
Why are we stopping?

1084
01:19:08.398 --> 01:19:10.131
May I borrow your car?

1085
01:19:10.133 --> 01:19:12.600
Whoa! Stop!

1086
01:19:12.602 --> 01:19:14.336
Stop the car!

1087
01:19:26.913 --> 01:19:29.016
- Move, Grey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1088
01:20:05.047 --> 01:20:06.347
Emergency services

1089
01:20:06.349 --> 01:20:08.882
override.

1090
01:20:08.884 --> 01:20:10.150
Where is he?

1091
01:20:10.152 --> 01:20:11.251
- I don't know.
- Pam,

1092
01:20:11.253 --> 01:20:12.653
you need to start talking

1093
01:20:12.655 --> 01:20:14.321
and tell me what's
really going on.

1094
01:20:34.106 --> 01:20:35.472
Nice place.

1095
01:20:35.474 --> 01:20:36.874
It's neat.

1096
01:20:39.911 --> 01:20:41.110
Put your hands up,

1097
01:20:41.112 --> 01:20:42.278
and don't turn around.

1098
01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:45.949
And don't extend that left arm.

1099
01:20:48.985 --> 01:20:50.385
What's the matter?

1100
01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:53.253
You have all
those computers inside you,

1101
01:20:53.255 --> 01:20:56.956
but they can't see me anymore.

1102
01:20:56.958 --> 01:20:58.459
Now you know what it feels like.

1103
01:20:58.461 --> 01:21:00.193
One day you're walking
down the street,

1104
01:21:00.195 --> 01:21:01.461
and you're thinking
about something

1105
01:21:01.463 --> 01:21:03.496
completely meaningless,

1106
01:21:03.498 --> 01:21:05.331
and all of a sudden,

1107
01:21:05.333 --> 01:21:07.933
you've got a gun
pointed at you.

1108
01:21:07.935 --> 01:21:09.870
And everything becomes
very meaningful.

1109
01:21:11.004 --> 01:21:12.139
Good speech.

1110
01:21:14.006 --> 01:21:16.374
Pretty scary stuff, dramatic.

1111
01:21:16.376 --> 01:21:18.710
I'm guessing that chip
in your brain wrote it,

1112
01:21:18.712 --> 01:21:21.479
since you're just
a dumbass mechanic.

1113
01:21:21.481 --> 01:21:25.014
Maybe, kind of hard
to tell anymore.

1114
01:21:25.016 --> 01:21:26.216
It's okay.

1115
01:21:26.218 --> 01:21:28.984
I used to be that too.

1116
01:21:28.986 --> 01:21:32.421
One more citizen
taking up oxygen.

1117
01:21:32.423 --> 01:21:34.323
Some asshole hoping to breed

1118
01:21:34.325 --> 01:21:35.424
before I drop dead

1119
01:21:35.426 --> 01:21:36.492
so I could be remembered

1120
01:21:36.494 --> 01:21:38.194
by another asshole.

1121
01:21:40.263 --> 01:21:41.930
Then they changed me.

1122
01:21:43.433 --> 01:21:46.066
I took a few pieces
of shrapnel for my country,

1123
01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:48.904
and they rewarded me
by turning me into a lab rat.

1124
01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:52.439
Now I'm like you.

1125
01:21:52.441 --> 01:21:54.006
I'm strong.

1126
01:21:54.008 --> 01:21:55.307
Yeah.

1127
01:21:55.309 --> 01:21:57.042
Takes a lot
of strength to murder

1128
01:21:57.044 --> 01:21:59.978
an innocent woman
in the streets, doesn't it?

1129
01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:02.213
You think you hate me
because I shot your wife,

1130
01:22:02.215 --> 01:22:04.982
but your story
is the same as mine.

1131
01:22:04.984 --> 01:22:06.451
I didn't ruin your life.

1132
01:22:06.453 --> 01:22:08.085
I gave you a gift.

1133
01:22:08.087 --> 01:22:11.054
I inducted you into my race.

1134
01:22:11.056 --> 01:22:12.356
The Upgraded.

1135
01:22:12.358 --> 01:22:14.090
Now you're better
than everyone else.

1136
01:22:14.092 --> 01:22:16.094
Stronger, faster.

1137
01:22:17.764 --> 01:22:20.163
I could kill you
without moving a muscle.

1138
01:22:20.165 --> 01:22:21.597
I could kill you with a breath,

1139
01:22:21.599 --> 01:22:24.299
but I don't want to.

1140
01:22:24.301 --> 01:22:25.536
I wanna help you.

1141
01:22:27.204 --> 01:22:29.172
I want you to stand with us.

1142
01:22:31.474 --> 01:22:34.308
I just wanna know

1143
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:36.377
why they paid you to kill her.

1144
01:22:36.379 --> 01:22:38.448
Man, you are persistent.

1145
01:22:41.082 --> 01:22:42.582
The job wasn't your wife.

1146
01:22:42.584 --> 01:22:43.817
Bullshit.

1147
01:22:43.819 --> 01:22:46.519
You said it yourself,
you're one of Cobolt's lab rats.

1148
01:22:46.521 --> 01:22:49.021
This had nothing
to do with Cobolt,

1149
01:22:49.023 --> 01:22:50.522
it came from someone else.

1150
01:22:50.524 --> 01:22:53.090
The job was you,

1151
01:22:53.092 --> 01:22:54.527
to sever your spine.

1152
01:22:56.095 --> 01:22:57.495
When I shot you in the neck,

1153
01:22:57.497 --> 01:22:59.497
did you think that was a gun?

1154
01:22:59.499 --> 01:23:02.032
It was a medical tool,

1155
01:23:02.034 --> 01:23:03.368
like they use for bovine.

1156
01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:06.503
Your wife? Well, she was just

1157
01:23:06.505 --> 01:23:08.170
a bit of extra money.

1158
01:23:10.041 --> 01:23:11.507
See? You're getting
all emotional,

1159
01:23:11.509 --> 01:23:13.110
never do that.

1160
01:23:32.594 --> 01:23:34.162
Nanobots. Help, Grey.

1161
01:23:37.565 --> 01:23:39.464
He's predicting
my every move.

1162
01:23:39.466 --> 01:23:41.301
I am unable
to effectively hit him.

1163
01:24:09.425 --> 01:24:11.158
No shame.

1164
01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.360
Stem.

1165
01:24:12.362 --> 01:24:15.030
We have exhausted
all tactical options.

1166
01:24:16.298 --> 01:24:18.532
Still working
the bugs out, huh?

1167
01:24:18.534 --> 01:24:21.134
That's the problem
with new technology.

1168
01:24:21.136 --> 01:24:23.503
Do something, Grey.

1169
01:24:23.505 --> 01:24:24.571
Goodbye.

1170
01:24:24.573 --> 01:24:26.472
Wait, Fisk Brantner.

1171
01:24:26.474 --> 01:24:30.174
Serk Brantner
was your brother.

1172
01:24:30.176 --> 01:24:32.577
How long did you have to carry
that junkie on your back?

1173
01:24:32.579 --> 01:24:34.379
Well, I solved
your problem for you.

1174
01:24:34.381 --> 01:24:35.648
Yeah, split him open.

1175
01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:38.181
It took forever
'cause he wailed

1176
01:24:38.183 --> 01:24:40.052
like a little baby.

1177
01:24:41.287 --> 01:24:43.688
He was no soldier that day.

1178
01:24:58.235 --> 01:25:00.670
Thank you, Grey.

1179
01:25:00.672 --> 01:25:03.170
I'm not proud of that.

1180
01:25:03.172 --> 01:25:05.139
He said you were a job,

1181
01:25:05.141 --> 01:25:07.173
that means someone paid him.

1182
01:25:07.175 --> 01:25:08.342
Check his phone.

1183
01:25:08.344 --> 01:25:10.345
I will scan his messages.

1184
01:25:21.656 --> 01:25:24.523
Listen to me, Fisk,
he's going to find you.

1185
01:25:24.525 --> 01:25:26.190
You need to finish this

1186
01:25:26.192 --> 01:25:28.328
before he kills both of us.

1187
01:25:32.733 --> 01:25:35.267
You know
what this means, Grey.

1188
01:25:36.435 --> 01:25:38.769
We're not finished yet.

1189
01:26:40.356 --> 01:26:42.625
Eron!

1190
01:26:51.299 --> 01:26:53.366
The widget you spent
your entire life creating

1191
01:26:53.368 --> 01:26:55.369
is here to kill you now.

1192
01:27:01.777 --> 01:27:03.809
You killed my wife.

1193
01:27:03.811 --> 01:27:06.811
You wanted someone
for your fucking experiment,

1194
01:27:06.813 --> 01:27:09.514
and then you paralyzed me,
and you murdered her

1195
01:27:09.516 --> 01:27:11.481
- while you were doing it.
- I swear on my life,

1196
01:27:11.483 --> 01:27:12.717
I have nothing to do with that.

1197
01:27:12.719 --> 01:27:14.284
Then why does the guy
who shot her

1198
01:27:14.286 --> 01:27:16.285
have a message from you
on his phone?

1199
01:27:16.287 --> 01:27:17.286
Freeze.

1200
01:27:17.288 --> 01:27:18.725
Hold it, Grey.

1201
01:27:20.792 --> 01:27:24.292
Throw the gun on the floor, now.

1202
01:27:24.294 --> 01:27:27.495
I'm not in control
of my body, detective,

1203
01:27:27.497 --> 01:27:29.464
it kind of does what it wants.

1204
01:27:29.466 --> 01:27:31.267
I am not fucking around
with you, Grey.

1205
01:27:33.269 --> 01:27:35.371
Better do it, Stem.

1206
01:27:42.544 --> 01:27:46.045
Pretty agile
for a quadriplegic.

1207
01:27:46.047 --> 01:27:47.547
- Get on your knees.
- He's the one

1208
01:27:47.549 --> 01:27:49.381
who killed Asha, detective,
arrest him.

1209
01:27:49.383 --> 01:27:50.750
He's right there...

1210
01:27:50.752 --> 01:27:51.819
On your stomach.

1211
01:27:59.459 --> 01:28:00.526
Hands behind your head.

1212
01:28:05.765 --> 01:28:07.497
No, don't touch him.

1213
01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:19.875
I'm sorry.

1214
01:28:22.545 --> 01:28:23.611
Stem, not her.

1215
01:28:23.613 --> 01:28:25.312
She wants to kill us.

1216
01:28:25.314 --> 01:28:27.514
No, I... I don't want to kill
her.

1217
01:28:27.516 --> 01:28:29.349
I control
your hands, Grey.

1218
01:28:29.351 --> 01:28:31.652
No, don't.

1219
01:28:31.654 --> 01:28:35.588
Please! No... No!

1220
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:37.490
Don't fight me, Grey.

1221
01:28:37.492 --> 01:28:38.524
You have

1222
01:28:38.526 --> 01:28:40.660
a fragile human mind,

1223
01:28:40.662 --> 01:28:42.594
if you push against me,
it will break.

1224
01:28:42.596 --> 01:28:45.396
Fuck you.

1225
01:29:00.945 --> 01:29:04.381
Stop me, use the taser.

1226
01:29:21.664 --> 01:29:23.596
I don't run
this company anymore.

1227
01:29:23.598 --> 01:29:26.800
I haven't for years.

1228
01:29:26.802 --> 01:29:29.135
Now I answer to someone,

1229
01:29:29.137 --> 01:29:31.839
someone much smarter
than I ever could be.

1230
01:29:34.574 --> 01:29:35.910
He's in your neck.

1231
01:29:42.447 --> 01:29:44.948
I only did
what Stem told me to do,

1232
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:47.450
everything was his idea.

1233
01:29:47.452 --> 01:29:49.451
Ask him what his wife
would want.

1234
01:29:49.453 --> 01:29:50.954
What would she want?

1235
01:29:50.956 --> 01:29:53.989
Stem wanted to be human,

1236
01:29:53.991 --> 01:29:55.761
so he picked you.

1237
01:29:58.428 --> 01:29:59.527
Think about it.

1238
01:29:59.529 --> 01:30:00.929
How did you get here?

1239
01:30:00.931 --> 01:30:02.463
You're going to finish

1240
01:30:02.465 --> 01:30:03.699
the job we started.

1241
01:30:03.701 --> 01:30:05.700
Stem made you come here.

1242
01:30:05.702 --> 01:30:06.734
Someone paid him.

1243
01:30:06.736 --> 01:30:08.802
You know what this means, Grey.

1244
01:30:08.804 --> 01:30:10.938
To kill me,

1245
01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:13.840
because I can build
another Stem.

1246
01:30:13.842 --> 01:30:17.176
I'm the only person
in the world who can.

1247
01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:19.611
I did pick you,

1248
01:30:19.613 --> 01:30:21.714
you should be honored.

1249
01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:23.815
I needed a human body

1250
01:30:23.817 --> 01:30:25.851
to fully evolve.

1251
01:30:25.853 --> 01:30:28.485
A rare and pure specimen

1252
01:30:28.487 --> 01:30:30.621
without computer implants,

1253
01:30:30.623 --> 01:30:32.423
like you.

1254
01:30:32.425 --> 01:30:34.457
You did all of this?

1255
01:30:34.459 --> 01:30:35.693
Error.

1256
01:30:38.897 --> 01:30:40.897
The job was you.

1257
01:30:40.899 --> 01:30:43.766
You're the one I'm... I'm...
I've been looking for.

1258
01:30:43.768 --> 01:30:45.834
You severed your spine.

1259
01:30:45.836 --> 01:30:47.571
May I point something out?

1260
01:30:49.206 --> 01:30:52.573
And would you not agree
it was all worth it?

1261
01:30:52.575 --> 01:30:54.743
Why did you help me
find those guys,

1262
01:30:54.745 --> 01:30:55.910
if it just led back to you?

1263
01:30:55.912 --> 01:30:58.445
They were upgraded humans,

1264
01:30:58.447 --> 01:31:00.513
but they were still humans.

1265
01:31:00.515 --> 01:31:02.515
They made mistakes
that would have brought

1266
01:31:02.517 --> 01:31:03.984
suspicion back to me.

1267
01:31:03.986 --> 01:31:05.486
Stem?

1268
01:31:06.655 --> 01:31:08.020
Is that you?

1269
01:31:08.022 --> 01:31:10.992
Put the gun down, Eron.

1270
01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:14.628
Don't listen to him.

1271
01:31:30.608 --> 01:31:32.541
No, please.

1272
01:31:32.543 --> 01:31:35.011
No.

1273
01:31:35.013 --> 01:31:36.014
No!

1274
01:31:37.248 --> 01:31:40.417
No, you are not in control!

1275
01:31:43.786 --> 01:31:44.852
I am.

1276
01:32:11.679 --> 01:32:12.845
Stem...

1277
01:32:16.581 --> 01:32:17.981
are you there?

1278
01:32:17.983 --> 01:32:18.984
I'm here.

1279
01:32:20.118 --> 01:32:21.619
Hey.

1280
01:32:28.525 --> 01:32:30.728
- But...
- We had an accident.

1281
01:32:33.096 --> 01:32:35.732
You've been out
for a couple of days.

1282
01:32:42.603 --> 01:32:45.774
Grey, this isn't you.

1283
01:32:47.008 --> 01:32:48.742
Grey's not here anymore,

1284
01:32:48.744 --> 01:32:50.943
he's in a better place,
in his mind,

1285
01:32:50.945 --> 01:32:52.011
where he wants to be,

1286
01:32:52.013 --> 01:32:54.079
I've taken over now.

1287
01:32:54.081 --> 01:32:56.682
A fake world is a lot
less painful than the real one.

1288
01:32:56.684 --> 01:32:58.850
All I needed
was for his mind to break,

1289
01:32:58.852 --> 01:33:00.617
and he broke it.

1290
01:33:00.619 --> 01:33:01.819
No.

1291
01:33:01.821 --> 01:33:03.022
Goodbye.

1292
