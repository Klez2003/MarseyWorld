WEBVTT

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:11.833
HEY, YEAH.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.300
THE 1960S?

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:16.333
HAPPY TIMES,
HEAVY TIMES.

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:32.467
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU GET YOUR
DAUGHTER, RIGHT?

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.867
SHE MIGHT BE CATHOLIC,

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.567
SHE MIGHT BE JEWISH,
SHE MIGHT BE ANYTHING.

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:38.067
SO YOU BRING HER UP
ON WHAT THEY CALL,

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:41.233
THE BOURGEOIS AMERICAN
TYPE SOCIETY FAMILY, YOU KNOW,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.967
YOU BRING 'EM UP SO THEY DON'T
SCREW UNTIL THEY GET MARRIED,

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:45.833
YOU TAKE 'EM TO CHURCH
ON SUNDAY,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.567
YOU TEACH 'EM
ALL YOU CAN

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:50.067
WHAT YOU--YOU THINK
YOU CAN TEACH 'EM ABOUT

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.733
HOW TO BRING UP A FAMILY,
HOW YOU SHOULD LOOK AND ACT,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.000
AND THEN YOU SEND 'EM TO
COLLEGE, YOU BUST YOUR HUMP,

00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:59.067
NO GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY,
NOBODY'S PAYIN' NOTHIN'.

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.700
YOU SAVE YOUR MONEY,
OR YOU BORROW THE MONEY,

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:04.067
YOU WORK OVERTIME,
YOU SEND HER TO COLLEGE.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.867
YOU WANT HER TO GET
AN EDUCATION.

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.067
THEN FIRST EASTER
SHE COMES HOME

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.500
ON A VACATION, SHE SAYS,
"DAD, I'M LIVIN'

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:11.700
WITH SOME GUY."

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:13.067
"YOU LIVIN' WITH SOME GUY?

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:14.867
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE LIVIN' WITH SOME GUY?"

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.100
WELL, THIS IS THE THING NOW.
FREE LOVE.

00:01:17.167 --> 00:01:19.300
WE'RE GETTIN' AWAY
FROM THE ORIGINAL POINT.

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:22.700
WHAT WE'RE TRYIN' TO FIND IS WHY
ARE THESE BASTARDS RIOTING.

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:24.467
BECAUSE THEY DID DOPE.

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.767
LISTEN, YOU'RE GOING
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:27.867
WHAT OF IT?

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.733
WHAT HAPPENS IS LOOK,
I'M SENDING YOU SCHOOL,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.300
I'M BREAKING MY ASS ON SENDING
YOU TO COLLEGE, RIGHT?

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:33.733
I EXPECT YOU'RE GOING
TO LEARN SOMETHING.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.133
WHY BE A JANITOR,
LEARN SOMETHING.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.967
JUSTIFY
MY INVESTMENT IN YOU.

00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:40.867
BUT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
REVEL IN THE FACT

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.300
THAT THESE KIDS
ARE LEADERS, ARE RABBLE-ROUSERS,

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:46.933
THIS SON OF A BITCH JUST
STARTED A RIOT.

00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:49.533
THESE KIDS THINK
THEY'RE THE FIRST GENERATION

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.800
THAT EVER SCREWED
BEFORE THEY GOT MARRIED.

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:52.800
WE ALL DID.

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:54.267
BUT WE ALWAYS HAD
ONE GIRL.

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:56.667
SHE SCREWED,
THAT GIRL YOU TOOK OUT.

00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:58.667
IT'S BETTER OFF
THESE KIDS DON'T GET MARRIED,

00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:00.667
BECAUSE IF THEY GET MARRIED,
THEY HAVEN'T GOT THE GUTS

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:02.167
TO STICK WITH IT.

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:46.533
HEY, YOU FUCKING
INTELLECTUALS.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.667
YOU THINK
YOU'RE SO WHERE IT'S AT

00:02:48.733 --> 00:02:49.900
BEFORE YOU FILL YOUR MINDS

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:50.900
WITH ANY JUNK

00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:52.267
BETTER LISTEN TO FRITZ THE CAT

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:53.800
'CAUSE WRITERS AND POETS
AND ARTISTS

00:02:53.867 --> 00:02:56.067
IT'S YOUR DUTY
TO LIVE LIFE TO THE MOST

00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:57.067
SO FLY OUT, BROTHERS,

00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:58.067
AND CHECK OUT THE WORLD

00:02:58.133 --> 00:02:59.433
GIVE ME A RIDE TO THE COAST

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.533
FRITZ THE CAT

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.900
HE FOUGHT MANY A GOOD MAN

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:03.400
LAID MANY A GOOD WOMAN

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:05.267
LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:07.367
CRY OUT FOR MORE
UNTIL IT BLEEDS

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:09.933
HELP ME,
HELP ME HELP YOU, MOTHER...

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:14.633
LOVE ME,

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.567
I HATE YOU, LOVE ME

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:18.567
I KILL YOU, LOVE ME

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:20.800
I LOVE YOU

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:24.833
WHAT A MOB IN THE PARK TODAY.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.667
GOD, THE PLACE
IS CRAWLING WITH PHONIES.

00:03:28.733 --> 00:03:30.933
YEAH, HIGH SCHOOL PUNKS.

00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:33.167
THOSE CREEPS ARE ALWAYS HERE
ON WEEKENDS, MAN.

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:34.833
MOST OF THEM ARE TOTAL JACKOFFS.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.867
SO MANY PEOPLE HERE
AND NOBODY HERE.

00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:38.533
-DIG THAT CHICK, MAN!

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.567
-OVER THERE?

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:41.400
MAN, LOOK AT THAT ASS ON HER!

00:03:41.467 --> 00:03:42.567
-WHAT A BABY CARRIAGE.

00:03:42.633 --> 00:03:43.667
-SO WHAT, MAN?

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:45.500
IF YOU HADN'T SHOWED UP SO LATE,

00:03:45.567 --> 00:03:47.067
WE'D BE ALL RIGHT NOW.

00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:48.333
-FRITZ ALWAYS DOES IT, MAN.
-EVERYBODY'S HERE

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.667
WITH THEIR GUITARS ALREADY.

00:03:49.733 --> 00:03:50.700
COOL, RIGHT, BUT THAT GUY--

00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:53.133
SIXTEEN VERSIONS
OF "LEMON TREE."

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.833
I JUST WANT SOMEPLACE
WHERE I CAN SLEEP.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.333
I MEAN, I CAN COOK.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.567
I CAN SEW AND DO HOUSEWORK
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:02.867
GET OUT THE GUITARS.

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:05.067
COME ON, GET THEM OUT.

00:04:05.067 --> 00:04:06.200
AND ONE, TWO, THREE.

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:08.600
ONCE I HAD A LITTLE GIRL

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:11.833
WHO WAS IN LOVE WITH ME

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.400
WELL, WELL, BABY,

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:15.133
I KNOW, I KNOW

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.400
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,

00:04:16.467 --> 00:04:18.067
YEAH, YEAH

00:04:20.933 --> 00:04:22.067
OH, MAMA, MAMA,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.133
SINGING IT, HO

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:32.567
DUMB CHICKS.

00:04:32.633 --> 00:04:34.367
-EASILY IMPRESSED BY SPADES.

00:04:34.433 --> 00:04:36.267
-IT'S THE THING, MAN.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.367
LOOK, I'M GONNA SPLIT.

00:04:46.433 --> 00:04:50.267
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:52.067
YEAH, HANG LOOSE, FRITZ.

00:04:52.067 --> 00:04:54.233
I'VE READ EVERYTHING
JAMES BALDWIN'S WRITTEN.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.333
HE HAS A TRUE SENSE OF

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.233
THE PROBLEMS OF BLACK PEOPLE.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.533
I WORKED FOR HEAD START
FOR FREE LAST SUMMER.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.900
BLACK KIDS
ARE SO MUCH GROOVIER.

00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:04.300
I WENT TO A COUPLE OF
BLACK PANTHER MEETINGS.

00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:06.967
THE TIME FOR
NON-VIOLENT REVOLUTION IS PAST.

00:05:07.067 --> 00:05:08.367
MORE POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.633
I'M TAKING A COURSE
IN AFRICAN STUDIES AT SCHOOL.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.367
I HAD NO IDEA YOU PEOPLE
WERE SO CIVILIZED.

00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:14.667
DO YOU KNOW
THAT PROPERTY VALUES

00:05:14.733 --> 00:05:17.767
ACTUALLY GO UP WHEN
A BLACK FAMILY MOVES IN?

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:20.667
FREUD DIDN'T WRITE
FOR THE BLACK MAN.

00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:22.933
WHY DOES A GREAT ACTOR
LIKE JAMES EARL JONES

00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:25.300
ALWAYS HAVE TO PLAY BLACK MEN?

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:28.133
DON'T YOU HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE
SAY "COLORED" OR "NEGRO"...

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.333
AND NOT "BLACK"?

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.667
BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL.

00:05:30.733 --> 00:05:32.067
IT'S SO GREAT THAT BLACK PEOPLE

00:05:32.067 --> 00:05:33.300
WEAR THEIR HAIR NATURAL...

00:05:33.367 --> 00:05:34.767
NOT EMULATING
THE IMAGE OF BEAUTY

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:36.667
THAT WHITE PEOPLE TRY TO
INFLICT UPON THEM.

00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:39.767
I HAD A BLACK GIRLFRIEND ONCE
WHO SAID THAT JEWISH PEOPLE

00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:41.300
WERE THE CLOSEST
TO BLACK PEOPLE.

00:05:41.367 --> 00:05:43.800
I'M JEWISH, YOU KNOW.

00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:48.500
I AIN'T NO JIVE-ASS
BLACK NIGGER, HONEY.

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:50.067
WHO DO YOU THINK I AM?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.200
GERALDINE?

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.300
OH, GOD!

00:06:02.367 --> 00:06:07.067
OH, JESUS!

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:08.300
HOW AWFUL.

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:10.400
MY SOUL IS TORMENTED.

00:06:10.467 --> 00:06:11.867
-GEE.
-OH, NO.

00:06:11.933 --> 00:06:14.467
I'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN THE FOUR
CORNERS OF THIS BIG OLD WORLD.

00:06:14.533 --> 00:06:15.533
I'VE SEEN IT ALL!

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.867
I'VE DONE IT ALL!

00:06:16.933 --> 00:06:18.533
-GEE.
-WOW.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.667
I'VE FOUGHT MANY A GOOD MAN,

00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:21.067
LAID MANY A GOOD WOMAN.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.900
I'VE HAD RICHES AND FAME
AND ADVENTURE.

00:06:26.767 --> 00:06:30.700
STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH DANGER
AND DEATH COUNTLESS TIMES.

00:06:30.767 --> 00:06:33.867
ARE YOU SOMEBODY FAMOUS?

00:06:33.933 --> 00:06:35.633
I THINK I SAW YOU
IN A MOVIE ONCE.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.233
TRY NOT TO INTERRUPT, HUH?

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.733
I'VE TASTED LIFE
TO THE FULLEST,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.867
AND STILL MY SOUL CRIES OUT...

00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:45.333
IN THIS HUNGRY, TORTURED,
WRECKED QUEST, "MORE!"

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.867
-LOOK AT THE GOOD SIDE OF LIFE.

00:06:46.933 --> 00:06:48.233
-THINGS AREN'T ALL BAD.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.967
GEE, HE'S HANDSOME.

00:06:50.067 --> 00:06:52.167
YOU. YOU CAN HELP ME.

00:06:52.233 --> 00:06:53.333
YOU MUST SAVE ME.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.100
BY SO DOING, YOU, TOO,
WILL BE SAVED.

00:06:56.167 --> 00:06:58.633
I'D LIKE TO, BUT WHAT CAN I DO?

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.900
LOVELY SET OF EYES THERE.

00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:02.767
LITTLE SWEET ONE
WITH YOUR HEART OF GOLD,

00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:04.300
I KNOW OF A PLACE
WHERE WE CAN BE ALONE

00:07:04.367 --> 00:07:08.667
TO JOIN OUR SOULS
IN SACRED TRUTH.

00:07:08.733 --> 00:07:11.133
HEY!

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.067
I WANT TO BE IN ON THIS THING.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.367
WHAT ABOUT MY SOUL,
YOU FINK?

00:07:15.433 --> 00:07:17.400
FOUR IN BED, THAT'S A KICK
I HAVEN'T TRIED YET.

00:07:17.467 --> 00:07:18.933
WHAT?

00:07:19.067 --> 00:07:20.333
YES. TOGETHER

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.600
WE SHALL ALL LEARN...

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:24.967
THE REAL EXISTENTIAL ESSENCE
OF THE LIFE FORCE.

00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:26.333
YES, "EXISTENTIAL."

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.600
I HEARD THAT WORD ONCE.

00:07:27.667 --> 00:07:31.367
-WHAT'S IT MEAN?
-"COOL," STUPID.

00:07:31.433 --> 00:07:34.300
YOU ARE A TRUE GENIUS, FRITZ.

00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:49.467
WILD, THIS IS WILD.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.633
OH, HONEY, I COULD GO...

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.267
I'LL GET IT. GOD DAMN IT.

00:08:25.733 --> 00:08:28.467
WHAT'S HAPPENING, MAN?

00:08:28.533 --> 00:08:32.200
HEY, FRITZ THE CAT HAS BECOME
THE STUD OF THE YEAR.

00:08:32.267 --> 00:08:36.733
WE'RE HAVING A SESSION HERE NOW,
SO I DON'T KNOW.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.100
ANYBODY USING THAT ROOM?

00:08:38.167 --> 00:08:40.067
THAT'S THE JOHN,
I MEAN...

00:08:40.067 --> 00:08:42.167
IF YOU'RE REALLY
STRUNG OUT, MAN.

00:08:42.233 --> 00:08:43.233
WE'LL TAKE IT.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:44.267
THIS WAY, GROUP.

00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:46.500
COME ALONG, NOW,
STEP LIVELY.

00:08:46.567 --> 00:08:47.433
WATCH YOUR STEP.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.867
THAT'S A GIRL.

00:08:48.933 --> 00:08:50.667
RUB-A-DUB-A-DUB.

00:08:50.733 --> 00:08:51.900
OK.

00:08:51.967 --> 00:08:54.067
A NEW WORLD OF EXPERIENCE
AWAITS US, MY LOVES.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.767
THIS BATHTUB
IS NOW TRANSFORMED

00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:57.500
INTO A SPACE CAPSULE
OF TRUTH AND LOVE.

00:08:57.567 --> 00:08:59.700
WOW! THIS IS WILD!

00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:02.867
ONLY IN NAKED CLOSENESS LIKE
THIS CAN WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER.

00:09:02.933 --> 00:09:05.767
YES! RIGHT!
VERY GOOD, WINSTON, DARLING.

00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:07.300
"NAKED CLOSENESS," TRUE.

00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:09.867
YOU ARE A PERCEPTIVE GIRL.

00:09:09.933 --> 00:09:11.667
CLOSENESS,
WE MUST ALL GET VERY CLOSE...

00:09:11.733 --> 00:09:13.067
AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE,

00:09:13.067 --> 00:09:15.200
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

00:09:15.267 --> 00:09:16.200
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:09:16.267 --> 00:09:18.500
LET'S ALL GET CLOSE TOGETHER.

00:09:18.567 --> 00:09:19.767
OH, BOY.

00:09:19.833 --> 00:09:22.100
CLOSENESS AND FULFILLMENT
OF OUR HIDDEN DESIRES

00:09:22.167 --> 00:09:23.933
THROUGH WHICH
WE REACH THE TRUTH.

00:09:24.067 --> 00:09:25.267
FULFILLMENT IS IMPORTANT.

00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:26.400
DON'T YOU THINK SO, WINSTON?

00:09:26.467 --> 00:09:27.867
OOH, YES.

00:09:27.933 --> 00:09:29.900
VERY IMPORTANT.

00:09:29.967 --> 00:09:31.500
OH, WOW, YEAH NOW,

00:09:31.567 --> 00:09:33.267
NOW I'M GETTING TO THE TRUTH,

00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:34.767
I THINK, YES.

00:09:34.833 --> 00:09:37.067
IT'S ALL VERY CLEAR NOW.

00:09:39.967 --> 00:09:41.467
OK, WINSTON.

00:09:41.533 --> 00:09:43.067
HERE COME THE TRUTH.

00:09:43.067 --> 00:09:44.700
YOU GOT THE WORD.

00:09:44.767 --> 00:09:45.833
OH, FRITZY.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.167
YOU GOT SUCH
AN EXISTENTIAL LITTLE BODY.

00:09:47.233 --> 00:09:49.567
JEEZ. WOW.

00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:50.867
OH, SHIT!

00:09:50.933 --> 00:09:52.333
MAYBE WE BETTER GO, HUH?

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.933
NO! NOT AT ALL!

00:09:54.067 --> 00:09:55.467
LOOK HERE.
YOU GET DOWN OVER HERE.

00:09:55.533 --> 00:09:57.733
AND YOU DOWN LIKE THAT.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.500
RIGHT UNDER HERE.
WATCH THE FOOT.

00:09:59.567 --> 00:10:00.967
THAT'S RIGHT,
RIGHT UNDER HERE.

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.000
OKAY, READY, EVERYONE.

00:10:03.067 --> 00:10:05.300
HERE WE GO.

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:21.533
HEY, RALPH,
I THINK THIS IS THE PLACE

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.967
WE GOT THE REPORT ON

00:10:23.033 --> 00:10:26.200
WITH THESE KIDS UPSTAIRS
DOING THE SHIT AND SMOKING,

00:10:26.267 --> 00:10:27.433
AND EVERYTHING,
I THINK.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.900
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
I NEVER WENT IN BEFORE.

00:10:28.967 --> 00:10:29.867
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

00:10:29.933 --> 00:10:31.200
WELL, ROB,
BECAUSE YOU'RE A ROOKIE

00:10:31.267 --> 00:10:33.033
AND THIS IS YOUR FIRST BEAT,
YOU JUST FOLLOW ME.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.467
WE WALK UP THE STEPS,
WE'LL MAKE NO NOISE.

00:10:35.533 --> 00:10:37.400
WE DON'T MAKE ANY NOISE.

00:10:37.467 --> 00:10:39.133
YOU FOLLOW ME SLOWLY, GOT THAT?

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.033
I DO. LIKE DICK TRACY.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.533
NO, IT'S LIKE
TERRY AND THE PIRATES.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.967
DICK TRACY'S OLD HAT.

00:10:45.033 --> 00:10:46.933
NOW, LET'S GO INSIDE.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.967
WAIT. COULD I GET
TO SEARCH THE GIRLS?

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:53.667
YEAH.
I'VE DONE ENOUGH OF THAT.

00:10:53.733 --> 00:10:56.800
HERE WE GO. AND WATCH ME,
'CAUSE I'M A NATURAL IN ACTION.

00:10:56.867 --> 00:10:58.367
UP THE STEPS.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.567
HEY, MAN.

00:11:11.633 --> 00:11:14.333
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON IN HERE?

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.400
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE,

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:16.967
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

00:11:17.067 --> 00:11:18.167
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE...

00:11:18.233 --> 00:11:20.433
FRITZ IS HAVING HIS OWN
PRIVATE LITTLE ORGY.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.067
MOVE OVER, MAN.

00:11:24.067 --> 00:11:24.967
WILL YOU GET OUT OF HERE?

00:11:25.067 --> 00:11:27.600
WE'RE SEEKING AFTER
THE TRUTH!

00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:30.800
IT'S MY BATHTUB, MAN.

00:11:30.867 --> 00:11:32.967
DON'T PAY ATTENTION
TO THAT FRITZ.

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:34.833
HE GOT A JESUS COMPLEX.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.700
OH, I KNOW IT.

00:11:46.933 --> 00:11:48.167
HAVE SOME JOY PUFF,

00:11:48.233 --> 00:11:51.233
SWEET LITTLE BIRD.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.367
HELLO, NEW YORK.

00:11:52.433 --> 00:11:54.167
HEARD YOU'RE HAVING
A HASH SESSION HERE.

00:11:54.233 --> 00:11:58.367
WOW, THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT.

00:11:58.433 --> 00:12:00.500
YES, MAN, COME JOIN US.

00:12:00.567 --> 00:12:02.500
GOOD STUFF AND LOTS OF IT, MAN.

00:12:02.567 --> 00:12:03.833
ONLY CLOSE THE DOOR.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.500
WE'RE MODEST.

00:12:09.067 --> 00:12:09.900
HAR HAR HAR.

00:12:09.967 --> 00:12:14.133
THE GUY'S A RIOT.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.900
OH, GOD, I'M THERE,
I'M THERE.

00:12:17.967 --> 00:12:19.433
YOU REALLY THERE?
HOW IS IT?

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.633
-IT'S...

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.200
-HOW IS IT?
-THAT'S FUNNY.

00:12:22.267 --> 00:12:23.767
I'M NOT THERE ANYMORE.

00:12:23.833 --> 00:12:25.767
OH, SHIT.

00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:26.800
I'M A WRITER.

00:12:26.867 --> 00:12:29.067
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.

00:12:29.133 --> 00:12:33.467
EVER MADE IT
WITH AN AARDVARK BEFORE?

00:12:33.533 --> 00:12:35.500
IT'S A RARE OPPORTUNITY,
YOU KNOW.

00:12:35.567 --> 00:12:36.967
WE'RE SCARCE.

00:12:37.067 --> 00:12:38.900
REALLY?

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:41.133
I CAN'T TELL
IF I'M THERE OR NOT.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.433
HOW DO YOU TELL?

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.433
YOU'LL KNOW WHEN YOU ARE.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.967
OH, BALLS.

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:48.133
IT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.667
I'M A FAILURE
AS A POT SMOKER.

00:12:50.733 --> 00:12:52.300
DON'T BE SAD.

00:12:52.367 --> 00:12:54.067
SOMEDAY YOU'LL MAKE IT.

00:12:54.067 --> 00:12:55.333
REALLY.

00:13:13.733 --> 00:13:15.900
SHH. I THINK WE'RE HERE.

00:13:30.667 --> 00:13:32.633
DO YOU HEAR ANYTHING, RALPH?

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.167
IT SOUNDS LIKE A BUNCH
OF DEGENERATES IN THERE.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.767
NOW, LISTEN, RALPH,

00:13:38.833 --> 00:13:40.733
YOU GOT THE DEEPER VOICE.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.767
AND I WANT YOU TO YELL,
"OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR."

00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:47.700
SAY THE WORD "FUCKING" BECAUSE
THAT MAKES YOU SOUND TOUGH.

00:13:47.767 --> 00:13:49.533
WHEN I SAY THREE,
YOU YELL, "OPEN..."

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.833
I'M EVEN GONNA AD-LIB.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.733
NO AD-LIBBING, RALPH.
NO AD-LIBBIN'.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.267
LET ME CALL THEM PRE-VERTS.
LET ME CALL 'EM PRE-VERTS.

00:13:56.333 --> 00:13:57.633
WHAT'S A PRE-VERT?

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.767
A PRE-VERT IS A DEGENERATE,
DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT?

00:14:00.833 --> 00:14:02.233
A PRE-VERT'S A DEGENERATE?

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.767
DIDN'T YOU HAVE NO BRINGING UP?

00:14:04.833 --> 00:14:07.367
I GOT BAR-MITZVAHED.

00:14:07.433 --> 00:14:09.667
YOU AIN'T SUPPOSED
TO LAUGH, RALPH!

00:14:09.733 --> 00:14:12.267
THIS IS A SERIOUS JOB
AND WE'RE GETTING PAID FOR IT.

00:14:12.333 --> 00:14:14.333
CUT THE FUCKING SHIT OUT.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.233
LET'S GO.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.333

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.833
OPEN UP IN THERE!

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.367
IT'S THE LAW! HIPPIE BASTARDS!

00:14:24.433 --> 00:14:26.867
GOOD, RALPH, DO IT AGAIN.

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:28.067
OKAY!

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.633
WHAT THE FUCK'S YOUR PROBLEM?

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.800
CUT IT OUT!
I WON'T LAUGH!

00:14:30.867 --> 00:14:33.067
OPEN THE DOOR, YOU PRE-VERTS!

00:14:33.133 --> 00:14:34.067
OPEN UP!

00:14:34.067 --> 00:14:35.733

OPEN UP! HERE WE ARE!

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.500
WOW! I CAN DO IT!

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:03.833
OH, BABY, DO I FEEL HIGH!

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.800
I'M FLYING!

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.667
WHAT A WONDERFUL, WIGGLY WORLD!

00:15:15.733 --> 00:15:18.433
WE'RE OUTSIDE,
BUT WE'LL GET IN!

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.533
-LAW AND ORDER'S HERE!

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.533

YOUR FUCKING BATH PARTY'S OVER!

00:15:34.467 --> 00:15:35.867
-OVER HERE!

00:15:35.933 --> 00:15:37.567
-THE COPS!

00:15:37.633 --> 00:15:39.533
RIGHT IN THE MOUTH!
YEAH! I LOVE IT!

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.633
TAKE THAT!

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.667
HEY, YOU!
GET YOUR HANDS OUT OF MY THING!

00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:43.800
-HERE WE ARE!

00:15:43.867 --> 00:15:44.833
-WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.967
OVER THERE! IN THE HEAD!

00:15:47.067 --> 00:15:48.833
GET YOUR HANDS
OFF OF MY DICK!

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.333
IN THE HEAD!

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.433
I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.767
RALPH, WHERE ARE YOU?

00:15:54.833 --> 00:15:57.067
RALPH, HELP! GOTCHA!

00:15:57.067 --> 00:15:58.167
NOW I GOTCHA!

00:15:58.233 --> 00:15:59.200
HERE, TAKE THAT!

00:15:59.267 --> 00:16:02.467
THAT'S MY...

00:16:02.533 --> 00:16:03.533
GOTCHA! IN THE HEART!

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.900
IN THE HEAD!
OVER THERE!

00:16:04.967 --> 00:16:06.067
WATCH THAT THING!

00:16:06.067 --> 00:16:10.300
WHERE'S THE CAT?

00:16:10.367 --> 00:16:11.900
WOW.

00:16:24.367 --> 00:16:27.067
HEY, LOOK AT
THIS BIG FUCKING GUN.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.967
I KILLED THE JOHN!
I KILLED THE JOHN!

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.833
KILL! DESTROY!

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.667
CAN YOU GIVE HIM YOUR GLASSES?

00:16:57.733 --> 00:16:59.233
BECAUSE I CAN'T.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.967
I HAVE TO LOOK.

00:17:01.067 --> 00:17:03.333
-YOU CAN'T SEE?
-I'LL GIVE THEM BACK.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.233
A LITTLE BIT...

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:11.067
OH, BOY, THIS IS GOOD FOR ME.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.300
CAN YOU DIG IT IN YOUR EYES?

00:17:12.367 --> 00:17:13.500
YOU'RE YOUNGER THAN ME.

00:17:13.567 --> 00:17:16.167
FORTY-FIVE, FORTY-EIGHT.

00:17:16.233 --> 00:17:19.600
I'M SIXTY-SEVEN.

00:17:19.667 --> 00:17:20.967
I WISH I KNEW.
I WOULD GIVE YOU GLASSES.

00:17:21.067 --> 00:17:23.100
I'D TAKE ANOTHER PAIR
FROM THE HOUSE.

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:26.067
I DIDN'T THINK
I WOULD NEED THE GLASSES.

00:17:30.167 --> 00:17:32.400
I'M NOT SO YOUNG NO MORE,
REMEMBER.

00:17:35.233 --> 00:17:37.500
YOU DON'T SEE NOTHING?

00:17:37.567 --> 00:17:39.300
I'M OLDER THAN YOU ARE,
I'LL SEE.

00:17:39.367 --> 00:17:41.567
I'LL MENTION THAT I SEE.

00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:51.600
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

00:17:51.667 --> 00:17:52.600
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

00:17:52.667 --> 00:17:53.867
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

00:17:53.933 --> 00:17:56.467
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
LOOK AT THE BOOK, RIGHT?

00:17:56.533 --> 00:18:00.633
SO SAY IT. SAY IT.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.533
ALL RIGHT.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.467
ALL RIGHT. GOOD.

00:18:05.533 --> 00:18:07.167
-GOOD.
-BEAUTIFUL.

00:18:07.233 --> 00:18:08.400
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

00:18:08.467 --> 00:18:09.633
JUST NORMAL.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:14.067
YOU KNOW, NICE AND QUIET.
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

00:18:14.133 --> 00:18:15.500
DON'T RUSH.

00:18:33.067 --> 00:18:36.500
MOTHER OF GOD,
I'M A FUCKING FUGITIVE.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.400
THIS IS THE PLACE!

00:18:53.467 --> 00:18:56.433
I SAW HIM COME IN HERE!

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.600
OH, MY GOD,
IT'S A SYNAGOGUE.

00:18:58.667 --> 00:19:00.067
WHAT KIND OF A PLACE IS THIS?

00:19:00.067 --> 00:19:01.300
A CHURCH?

00:19:01.367 --> 00:19:02.800
LISTEN, I CAN HEAR THEM.

00:19:02.867 --> 00:19:04.167
DON'T SOUND LIKE ENGLISH.

00:19:04.233 --> 00:19:07.567
ARE THEY PUERTO RICANS?

00:19:07.633 --> 00:19:10.333
RALPH,
YOU'RE TRYING MY PATIENCE.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.300
YOU GO DOWN THAT AISLE,
I'LL GO DOWN THIS AISLE.

00:19:13.367 --> 00:19:16.867
IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU SAID SOMETHING BRIGHT.

00:19:16.933 --> 00:19:17.800
RALPH, PLEASE BE QUIET.

00:19:17.867 --> 00:19:19.067
IT'S MY PEOPLE.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.567
-EXCUSE ME, RABBI.

00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:37.900
-THEY ALL GOT LONG HAIR.

00:19:37.967 --> 00:19:39.467
-SORRY, RABBI.

00:19:39.533 --> 00:19:41.067
-THEY ALL GOT LONG CLOTHES.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.067
-EXCUSE ME.

00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:43.600
-MUST BE A HIPPIE CHURCH.

00:19:43.667 --> 00:19:45.667
HI, RABBI.

00:19:45.733 --> 00:19:47.433
DID YOU SEE HIM?

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.867
SHH!

00:19:52.867 --> 00:19:56.633
GOD.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.333
RALPH,
WOULD YOU PLEASE SHUT UP?

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.033
I AIN'T TALKING LOUD.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.333
EXCUSE ME, RABBI.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.333
HI, MA.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.867
EXCUSE ME, RABBI.

00:20:05.933 --> 00:20:06.867
UNCLE BEN, HOW ARE YOU?

00:20:06.933 --> 00:20:10.333
I'M CATCHING A CRIMINAL.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.500
EXCUSE ME, RABB...
IT'S YOU.

00:20:12.567 --> 00:20:14.500
DID YOU FIND HIM?

00:20:14.567 --> 00:20:16.600
NO, HE WAS OVER THERE, BUT...

00:20:20.767 --> 00:20:21.967
-BUT I WAS JUST TELLING YOU...

00:20:22.033 --> 00:20:23.300
-CUT IT OUT!

00:20:23.367 --> 00:20:24.467
BUT I WAS JUST...

00:20:24.533 --> 00:20:26.800
I AIN'T TALKING LOUD!

00:20:33.033 --> 00:20:35.400
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:20:35.467 --> 00:20:37.400
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:43.900
YOU SAVED MY LIFE!

00:20:56.933 --> 00:20:58.900
WE INTERRUPT
THE ISRAELI-ARAB WAR

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:00.767
FOR THIS SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:21:00.833 --> 00:21:02.333
THE PRESIDENT,
AFTER CONFERRING

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.967
WITH THE ISRAELI
PRIME MINISTER GOLDA MEIR,

00:21:05.067 --> 00:21:08.067
HAS AGREED TO SEND MORE ARMS

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.767
BASED ON THE RETURN OF
NEW YORK CITY AND LOS ANGELES

00:21:10.833 --> 00:21:13.067
TO THE UNITED STATES.

00:21:13.067 --> 00:21:15.633
MAZEL TOV! MAZEL TOV!

00:21:23.733 --> 00:21:26.133
STOP, YOU MOTHERFUCKING CAT!

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.667
STOP IN THE NAME OF THE LAW!

00:21:27.733 --> 00:21:29.500
STOP!

00:21:44.267 --> 00:21:46.600
STUPID, RALPH,
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DANCE.

00:21:46.667 --> 00:21:48.367
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO BREAK THE CIRCLE!

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:50.100
-YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DANCE.

00:21:50.167 --> 00:21:51.533
-I GOT MUSICAL FEET.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.500
YOU DUMB ROOKIE.

00:21:53.567 --> 00:21:55.200
DUMB ROOKIE!

00:21:55.267 --> 00:21:57.433
YOU DUMB ROOKIE!

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.100
DUMB ROOKIE!

00:21:59.167 --> 00:22:02.333
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO DANCE, RALPH,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.167
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT JEWISH!

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.433
I HAD A GREAT THING GOING TILL
THE FRIGGING FUZZ SHOWED UP.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.700
I WISH THAT SKINNY BROAD
DIDN'T TURN ON THE SHOWER, TOO.

00:22:42.767 --> 00:22:46.067
I THINK I'M GETTING A COLD.

00:22:46.133 --> 00:22:50.167
HELLO, MEN. EVERYBODY STUDYING
FOR THEIR GODDAMN EXAMS?

00:22:50.233 --> 00:22:52.133
HEY, BUZZ, HOW'D IT GO
WITH THAT DEE-DEE CHICK?

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.467
SHE'S GOT SOME BOD,

00:22:53.533 --> 00:22:55.300
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT.

00:22:55.367 --> 00:22:57.167
CHARLENE ISN'T BAD,
EITHER, THOUGH, RIGHT?

00:22:57.233 --> 00:22:59.867
LIKE WOW!

00:23:00.067 --> 00:23:02.700
HINES!
YOU SWINE, OLD BUDDY PIG!

00:23:02.767 --> 00:23:03.800
YOU GROOVE BEHIND ALVINA,

00:23:03.867 --> 00:23:05.600
GET SOME KICKS TONIGHT?

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.633
BASTARDS. YOU'D THINK
THE GODDAMN EXAMS WAS THE BE-ALL

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.600
AND END-ALL OF EXISTENCE.

00:23:13.667 --> 00:23:16.433
COSMIC LIFE FORCE
OR SOMETHING.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.267
YOU'D THINK THEY WERE
THE FRIGGING FUGITIVES.

00:23:19.333 --> 00:23:22.100
CAN'T EVEN GET IN
A FEW DECENT WORDS TO A GUY.

00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:24.267
BASTARDS.

00:23:24.333 --> 00:23:25.933
WHAT A BORE,
THEY JUST SIT THERE...

00:23:26.067 --> 00:23:27.167
AND TAKE BENNIES

00:23:27.233 --> 00:23:28.900
AND STAY UP ALL NIGHT
WITH THEIR FACE STUCK

00:23:28.967 --> 00:23:31.967
IN A BUNCH OF BOOKS
AND THEIR THUMB UP THEIR ASS.

00:23:32.067 --> 00:23:34.200
YES, YES,
I REMEMBER THE TIME

00:23:34.267 --> 00:23:36.933
WHEN IT WAS ALL VERY INSPIRING
AND ENLIGHTENING,

00:23:37.067 --> 00:23:41.067
ALL THIS HISTORY AND LITERATURE
AND SOCIOLOGY SHIT.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.900
YOU THINK LEARNING
IS A REALLY BIG THING

00:23:42.967 --> 00:23:44.967
AND YOU BECOME
THIS BIG FUCKING INTELLECTUAL

00:23:45.067 --> 00:23:47.067
AND SIT AROUND TRYING
TO OUT-INTELLECTUAL

00:23:47.133 --> 00:23:49.733
ALL THE OTHER BIG
FUCKING INTELLECTUALS.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.167
YOU SPEND YEARS AND YEARS
WITH YOUR NOSE BURIED

00:23:52.233 --> 00:23:54.633
IN THESE GODDAMN TOMES

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:59.067
WHILE THE WORLD
IS PASSING YOU BY.

00:23:59.067 --> 00:24:01.067
ALL THE STUFF TO SEE...

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.800
AND ALL THE KICKS...

00:24:02.867 --> 00:24:05.200
AND ALL THE GIRLS
ARE OUT THERE.

00:24:05.267 --> 00:24:07.100
AND ME, A WRITER!

00:24:07.167 --> 00:24:09.367
AND A POET WHO SHOULD BE
HAVING ADVENTURES

00:24:09.433 --> 00:24:11.333
AND EXPERIENCING
ALL THE DIVERSITIES

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.767
AND PARADOXES
AND IRONIES OF LIFE,

00:24:13.833 --> 00:24:17.067
AND PASSING OVER
ALL THE ROADS OF THE WORLD!

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:21.667
AND DIGGING ALL THE CITIES
AND TOWNS AND RIVERS

00:24:21.733 --> 00:24:24.767
AND THE OCEANS AND...

00:24:24.833 --> 00:24:27.467
MAKING ALL OF THEM CHICKS.

00:24:27.533 --> 00:24:30.900
OH, GOD.

00:24:30.967 --> 00:24:33.600
AS A WRITER AND A POET,
IT IS MY DUTY TO GET OUT THERE

00:24:33.667 --> 00:24:35.200
AND DIG THE WORLD...

00:24:35.267 --> 00:24:36.967
TO SWIM IN
THE WHOLE FRIGGING SCENE,

00:24:37.067 --> 00:24:40.067
WHILE THERE IS
STILL TIME, MAN.

00:24:40.067 --> 00:24:42.100
MY FARTING AROUND DAYS
ARE OVER, BABY.

00:24:42.167 --> 00:24:46.833
FROM THIS DAY ON, I SHALL LIVE
EVERY DAY AS IF IT WAS MY LAST.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.733
YEAH, I MUST DO IT!

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.533
NO MORE OF THE DREARY,
BORING CLASSES,

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.900
DISMAL LECTURES,

00:24:52.967 --> 00:24:54.300
SITTING AROUND BULLSHITTING

00:24:54.367 --> 00:24:56.300
WITH PRETENTIOUS
FAT-ASS HIPPIES.

00:24:56.367 --> 00:24:57.400
NO MORE OF THE BOOKS,

00:24:57.467 --> 00:24:59.600
THE SPOUTINGS OF
A BUNCH OF OLD FARTS

00:24:59.667 --> 00:25:03.167
WHO THINK THEY KNOW
THE WHOLE GODDAMN SCORE.

00:25:09.133 --> 00:25:10.967
OH, MY GOD, WHAT HAVE I DONE?

00:25:15.467 --> 00:25:17.433
I SET ALL MY NOTES
AND BOOKS ON FIRE

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.100
AND NOW I CAN'T STUDY
FOR MY EXAMS.

00:25:20.167 --> 00:25:22.833
I'LL FLUNK OUT,
AND MY FOLKS WILL BE PISSED OFF.

00:25:26.333 --> 00:25:29.900
I'LL GET A BLANKET.

00:25:29.967 --> 00:25:32.600
THE BLANKET'S ON FIRE.

00:25:32.667 --> 00:25:34.900
WE BETTER CALL
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

00:25:45.267 --> 00:25:49.533
BO DIDDLEY BUY HIS BABY
A DIAMOND RING

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:54.067
IF THAT DIAMOND RING
DON'T SHINE

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.067
HE GONNA TAKE IT

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.500
TO A PRIVATE EYE

00:25:58.567 --> 00:26:03.200
IF THAT PRIVATE EYE
CAN'T SEE

00:26:03.267 --> 00:26:05.667
HE BETTER NOT TAKE
THAT RING FROM ME

00:26:23.433 --> 00:26:27.900
BO DIDDLEY CAUGHT HIM
A NANNY GOAT

00:26:27.967 --> 00:26:32.600
TO MAKE HIS PRETTY BABY
A SUNDAY COAT

00:26:32.667 --> 00:26:36.967
BO DIDDLEY CAUGHT HIM
A BEAR CAT

00:26:37.067 --> 00:26:39.567
TO MAKE HIS PRETTY BABY
A SUNDAY HAT

00:27:21.933 --> 00:27:26.133
MAYBE SOMEDAY
YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:30.900
AS I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU,
BABY

00:27:30.967 --> 00:27:32.867
THE ONE YOU LOVE

00:27:32.933 --> 00:27:36.733
JUST KEEP FALLING IN LOVE
WITH YOU

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.500
THEN WHEN
YOU ALL ALONE

00:27:40.567 --> 00:27:42.967
YOU KNOW IT'D BE BEST, BABY

00:27:43.067 --> 00:27:44.300
YOU CAN SING LIKE THAT.

00:27:44.367 --> 00:27:47.667
LITTLE COQUETTE, I LOVE YOU

00:27:47.733 --> 00:27:48.733
SING, 'CAUSE I WANT TO...

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.167
IF I GET TIRED, I QUIT.

00:27:51.233 --> 00:27:52.867
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO SING.

00:27:52.933 --> 00:27:54.333
I WANT TO SING, MAN.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.433
I'M GOOD.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:56.900
YOU SING AS GOOD AS YOU WANT.

00:27:56.967 --> 00:27:58.233
IF I GET TIRED, I QUIT.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.667
I WENT TO SCHOOL IN OAKLAND...

00:28:00.733 --> 00:28:05.733
AND I HAD QUITE A FEW WHITE-TYPE
OF SCHOOL KIDS WITH ME.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.300
I'M FORTY-NINE.

00:28:08.367 --> 00:28:12.733
AT THAT TIME, I HAD WHITE KIDS
GOING TO SCHOOL WITH ME.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.367
I WOULD HAVE PEANUT BUTTER.

00:28:16.433 --> 00:28:18.567
I GOT SOME PEANUT BUTTER, DON'T
LIE, I DON'T WANT IT...

00:28:18.633 --> 00:28:21.700
BUT I ATE SO MUCH WHEN
MY MOTHER GAVE IT TO ME.

00:28:21.767 --> 00:28:23.533
WITH APPLE BUTTER.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.367
I GOT TWO CANS OF IT NOW.

00:28:26.433 --> 00:28:29.500
THAT I DON'T EAT BECAUSE...

00:28:29.567 --> 00:28:31.333
WHITEY WAS EATING
HAM SANDWICHES,

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.500
AND I WAS EATING
PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICHES.

00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:38.433
SANDWICHES!

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.900
I GOT TO GET OUT OF THIS TOWN
FOR SOME SOUTHERN TIMES.

00:28:40.967 --> 00:28:42.933
LET ME OUT OF HERE.
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:28:43.067 --> 00:28:46.900
SUCK! THE BUS ONLY COST
$17 TO NEW YORK.

00:28:46.967 --> 00:28:47.967
I SAY, "I AIN'T MADE

00:28:48.067 --> 00:28:52.700
$17 IN TWO WEEKS."

00:28:52.767 --> 00:28:54.500
GOT AIR TO LIVE.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.867
RIDING A SHIP
COMING OUT OF PEARL HARBOR.

00:29:08.867 --> 00:29:12.167
AND ALL MY WHITE FRIENDS...

00:29:12.233 --> 00:29:16.900
THEN WE DRANK WATER
OUT OF THE DITCHES.

00:29:16.967 --> 00:29:18.067
IF I HAD A K-RATION,

00:29:18.133 --> 00:29:21.067
I GAVE THEM SOME OF IT.

00:29:21.067 --> 00:29:23.233
AND...

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.200
I WOULD RIDE THIS BUS.

00:29:25.267 --> 00:29:28.367
I COULDN'T SIT WITH MY FRIEND
ON THIS BUS AT HOUSTON, TEXAS.

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:30.267
I HAD TO RIDE
AT THE BACK END OF THIS BUS.

00:29:30.333 --> 00:29:31.967
I'M ABOUT TO GET HOT NOW.

00:29:32.067 --> 00:29:33.333
AS A MATTER OF FACT...

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.133
YOU COULDN'T EVEN GO NO PLACE
DOWN SOUTH RIDING A BUS.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.667
COULDN'T EVEN GET A SODA...
WALK IN THERE

00:29:45.733 --> 00:29:47.600
AND GET YOU A SANDWICH.

00:29:52.267 --> 00:29:54.067
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT WHO'S RACIST.

00:29:54.067 --> 00:29:55.500
I JUST WANT EQUALITY.

00:29:55.567 --> 00:29:56.767
BE EQUAL WITH THE NEXT GUY,

00:29:56.833 --> 00:29:58.400
BECAUSE I'M PAYING MY TAXES.

00:29:58.467 --> 00:29:59.533
THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING NOW.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.667
I'M A WORKING MAN,

00:30:00.733 --> 00:30:01.733
AND I'M PAYING MY TAXES.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.867
THE MONEY IS WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:30:03.933 --> 00:30:05.533
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.500
IT ALL COUNTS...

00:30:06.567 --> 00:30:07.600
WHEN IS WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:30:07.667 --> 00:30:09.100
I'M TALKING ABOUT
AS FAR AS, LIKE,

00:30:09.167 --> 00:30:11.200
IF YOU WANT
TO BE REVOLUTIONARY,

00:30:11.267 --> 00:30:14.167
YOU GET SOME BREAD FIRST,
AND THEN YOU CAN TALK TRASH.

00:30:14.233 --> 00:30:17.100
WHITEY BLIND US WITH RELIGION.

00:30:19.933 --> 00:30:21.433
IF YOU FIGHT
VIOLENCE WITH VIOLENCE,

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.500
LIKE THE LATE MALCOLM DID,
YOU'LL GET SOME RESULTS.

00:30:25.567 --> 00:30:26.567
RIGHT.

00:30:26.633 --> 00:30:27.933
BECAUSE BEFORE
THIS RIOTING AND SHIT,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.467
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
NO HEAD START PROGRAMS FOR KIDS.

00:30:30.533 --> 00:30:32.433
YOU DIDN'T HAVE SHIT!

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.933
REALLY. YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A GODDAMN THING.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.967
GOT YOU DOWN IN HARLEM
SELLING HORSEMEAT.

00:30:39.033 --> 00:30:40.567
YOU KNOW,
IF ONE OF THEM MOTHERFUCKERS

00:30:40.633 --> 00:30:43.700

HORSEMEAT, THEY DEAD.

00:30:43.767 --> 00:30:46.300
-ANOTHER CIVIL WAR.
-CIVIL WAR.

00:30:46.367 --> 00:30:48.900
AND I'M GONNA BE
STANDING BACK,

00:30:48.967 --> 00:30:50.600
"GET 'EM, BABY!"

00:31:00.267 --> 00:31:02.133
HEY, MAN, YOU IN A BAG?

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.167
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

00:31:03.233 --> 00:31:04.567
I'M IN A BAG.

00:31:04.633 --> 00:31:06.300
JUST DON'T LOSE
YOUR COOLNESS, CAT,

00:31:06.367 --> 00:31:08.967
I MEAN,
DON'T LOSE YOUR COOLNESS.

00:31:16.333 --> 00:31:17.433
EASY FOR YOU TO TALK.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.833
YOU'RE A CROW.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.200
I WISH I WAS A CROW.

00:31:21.267 --> 00:31:23.367
IF I WAS A CROW,
I'D FLY AWAY, MAN.

00:31:23.433 --> 00:31:26.467
I'D FLY AWAY FROM
THIS MISERABLE TOWN FOR GOOD.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.333
YOU THINK BEING A CROW
IS A BIG MOTHERFUCKING BALL?

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.167
ALL YOU CATS THE SAME, MAN.

00:31:41.233 --> 00:31:42.400
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.

00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:44.700
THERE'S NOBODY TO TELL YOU
WHERE IT'S AT.

00:31:44.767 --> 00:31:47.067
AND YOU COME UP HERE,
TRY TO FIND OUT WHERE IT'S AT,

00:31:47.067 --> 00:31:50.800
BUT YOU GOT TO BE UP HERE, MAN,
TO FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:31:50.867 --> 00:31:53.067
I KNOW IT ISN'T A BALL, MAN.

00:31:53.133 --> 00:31:55.533
I STUDIED THE RACE PROBLEMS.
I KNOW.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.900
YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT THE RACE PROBLEM.

00:31:57.967 --> 00:32:00.333
GOT TO BE A CROW TO KNOW
ABOUT THE RACE PROBLEM.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.333
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.333
DO YOU DIG WHERE I'M AT?

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.800
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

00:32:04.867 --> 00:32:08.500
MAN, THIS THING AFFECTS ME
VERY DEEPLY, FELLA.

00:32:08.567 --> 00:32:11.533
AS A CAT, I HAVE
A CONSIDERABLE GUILT COMPLEX

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.633
BECAUSE MY KIND HAVE ALWAYS
BROUGHT SUFFERING ON YOUR KIND.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.400
-YEAH?

00:32:36.067 --> 00:32:39.867
YES, INDEED, MY SOUL
IS TORTURED AND TORMENTED

00:32:39.933 --> 00:32:42.167
BY THIS RACIAL CRISIS.

00:32:42.233 --> 00:32:43.900
NO SHIT?

00:32:43.967 --> 00:32:45.200
I KID YOU NOT, MAN.

00:32:45.267 --> 00:32:47.433
SOMETIMES I REALLY GET
HUNG UP ABOUT IT.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.233
YOU KNOW, UPTIGHT.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.733
-STRUNG OUT.
-IN A BAG?

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.700
YEAH, IN A BAG!

00:33:19.933 --> 00:33:21.533
I'M GONNA BUY YOU A DRINK, CAT.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.567
JUST 'CAUSE I THINK
YOU GOT COOLNESS.

00:33:23.633 --> 00:33:24.633
GREAT.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.067
HEY, BOY, CAN I HAVE A DRINK?

00:33:30.467 --> 00:33:32.633

HEY, CAT, HOW WOULD YOU

00:34:33.067 --> 00:34:34.233

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.433
-IT'S A BUG OUT TO HIM.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.467
-IT'S SOME KIND OF DANCE.

00:34:46.533 --> 00:34:48.267
-LET'S SPLIT.

00:35:21.233 --> 00:35:23.567
ANYBODY LOOKING OUR WAY?

00:35:23.633 --> 00:35:24.967

00:37:17.767 --> 00:37:21.333

HOW'S THE CROWD TONIGHT?

00:40:38.233 --> 00:40:39.400

00:40:39.467 --> 00:40:40.500
WE'RE PUSHING ENOUGH GRASS

00:40:40.567 --> 00:40:43.500
TO MAKE OUR MONEY.

00:40:43.567 --> 00:40:45.333
JUST ENOUGH.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.400
BUT IT SURE AIN'T LIKE

00:40:46.467 --> 00:40:48.133
THE GOOD OLD DAYS IN HARLEM...

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.533
WHEN WHITE MONEY WAS BOSS...

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.733

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.600
SPREADING IT ALL AROUND

00:40:53.667 --> 00:40:55.600
BIG BERTHA.

00:40:55.667 --> 00:40:59.367
OH, CHILD.

00:40:59.433 --> 00:41:00.367

ALL THOSE PEACE MARCHES...

00:41:01.933 --> 00:41:04.800
SIT-INS, RIOTS, AND 'DOS.

00:41:04.867 --> 00:41:05.867
AIN'T NOTHING WRONG

00:41:05.933 --> 00:41:09.533
WITH NO PEACE MARCHES.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:15.467
IT'S ME, BABY.

00:41:15.533 --> 00:41:18.267
WHO'S THAT JOKER?

00:41:18.333 --> 00:41:19.267

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.333
WE SHALL OVERCOME!

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.200
GROUP COMMANDER TO FORMATION B.

00:51:52.267 --> 00:51:54.133
DON'T GIVE THEM
A CHANCE TO SCATTER.

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.067
ATTACK ALL CONGESTED AREAS.

00:53:05.667 --> 00:53:08.433
I'VE GOT TO FIND HIM.

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.767
WHERE COULD HE BE?

00:53:11.833 --> 00:53:15.500
THIS IS THE ALLEY BEHIND
THAT PLACE HE WAS STANDING AT.

00:53:15.567 --> 00:53:17.933
IT GIVES ME THE CREEPS.

00:53:18.067 --> 00:53:19.933
FRITZ! FRITZ!

00:53:20.067 --> 00:53:22.867
GOOD EVENING, MADAM.

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:24.100
OH, FRITZ!

00:53:24.167 --> 00:53:27.600
THANK GOD I FOUND YOU.

00:53:27.667 --> 00:53:29.100
JOIN ME, WINSTON, MY LOVE.

00:53:29.167 --> 00:53:32.933
IT'S NOT VERY PRETTY LOOKING,
BUT IT'S COZY AS A BITCH.

00:53:33.067 --> 00:53:34.100
FRITZ, COME OUT OF THERE,

00:53:34.167 --> 00:53:35.400
WILL YOU PLEASE?

00:53:35.467 --> 00:53:39.067
THE HELL! WITH THE FUZZ
COMBING THE CITY FOR ME?

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:40.867
HAS MY PICTURE
APPEARED ON TV YET?

00:53:40.933 --> 00:53:42.900
HAVE THEY BROADCAST AN ALARM?

00:53:42.967 --> 00:53:45.800
OFFERED A REWARD FOR INFORMATION
LEADING TO MY ARREST?

00:53:45.867 --> 00:53:47.967
DON'T BE SO MELODRAMATIC.

00:53:48.067 --> 00:53:50.600
YOU AND YOUR ILLUSIONS
OF GRANDEUR.

00:53:50.667 --> 00:53:53.767
I'M NOT GETTING IN THAT FILTHY,
GRIMY GARBAGE CAN WITH YOU.

00:53:53.833 --> 00:53:55.533
GO FUCK YOURSELF.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:57.367
YOU'RE SUCH A CHILD.

00:53:57.433 --> 00:54:02.533
SUCH A SELF-CENTERED,
EGOTISTICAL CHILD.

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:04.467
THIS IS DISGUSTING.

00:54:04.533 --> 00:54:06.533
IF YOU'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT
MY GARBAGE CAN THAT WAY...

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.633
JUST GET THE HELL OUT.

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.300
FRITZ, ARE YOU STILL GOING
TO BUG OUT OR NOT?

00:54:11.367 --> 00:54:12.467
ARE YOU KIDDING, TOOTS?

00:54:12.533 --> 00:54:14.467
I GOT NO CHOICE AT THIS POINT.

00:54:14.533 --> 00:54:15.767
LISTEN TO ME, WILL YOU?

00:54:15.833 --> 00:54:18.567
I'VE GOT A CAR AND SOME MONEY.

00:54:18.633 --> 00:54:20.133
I CAN GET
ALL THE THINGS WE NEED...

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.333
AND WE CAN LEAVE RIGHT AWAY.

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:23.067
WE CAN GO OUT TO THE COAST.

00:54:23.133 --> 00:54:25.133
I'LL GET A GOOD JOB
AS A PRIVATE SECRETARY...

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.633
AND YOU CAN WORK
ON YOUR POETRY AND ALL.

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:31.233
WE CAN GET MARRIED AND RENT
A NICE LITTLE PAD IN FRISCO...

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:32.633
AND DIG THE SCENE OUT THERE.

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:33.900
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A GREAT TOWN.

00:54:33.967 --> 00:54:38.200
FRISCO. YEAH, OK.

00:54:38.267 --> 00:54:41.900
* SHE MAKES MEN INTO BOYS
SHE MAKES GIANTS INTO MEN *

00:54:41.967 --> 00:54:44.567
* SHE'LL HAVE YOU FEELING
GUILTY BEFORE YOU CAN COUNT TO
TEN *

00:54:44.633 --> 00:54:48.067
* POOR WINSTON, SHARP MIND
AND A BODY TO MATCH *

00:54:48.133 --> 00:54:50.167
* POOR WINSTON
FINE FANCY KARMA *

00:54:50.233 --> 00:54:51.700
* ABLE, TOO, AT THAT *

00:54:51.767 --> 00:54:54.867
* WHO IS THE GIRL
IN THE FIBERGLASS SHORTS *

00:54:54.933 --> 00:54:57.800
* WELL, IT'S GOT TO BE
WINSTON SCHWARTZ *

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:08.167
* YOU CAN'T OUTTALK HER
'CAUSE SHE TALKS TOO FAST *

00:55:08.233 --> 00:55:11.100
* YOU CAN'T OUTTHINK HER,
SHE'S A NEW YORK FLASH *

00:55:11.167 --> 00:55:14.367
* SHE MAKES LOVE TO YOU
AND TELL YOU YOU'RE IN LOVE *

00:55:14.433 --> 00:55:16.067
* YOU MAKE LOVE TO HER *

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:21.333
* SHE SAYS YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO IT, POOR WINSTON **

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.833
AH, WINSTON,
MY LOVE.

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.933
AT LAST WE'RE ZOOMING DOWN
THAT OLD LONESOME HIGHWAY.

00:55:26.067 --> 00:55:28.633
IT'S WILD.

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:30.833
YEAH. MARVELOUS.

00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:31.967
MARVELOUS, MY ASS!

00:55:32.067 --> 00:55:34.100
IT'S EXALTING. ELATING.

00:55:34.167 --> 00:55:37.833
THE COOL NIGHT WIND
BLOWING PAST THE WINDOW. MAN!

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:39.233
I'M HUNGRY.

00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:41.267
LET'S STOP SOMEPLACE.
THE HELL WITH STOPPING.

00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:43.300
I JUST WANT TO FEEL
THOSE MILES FLYING BY.

00:55:43.367 --> 00:55:45.067
I'M HUNGRY!

00:55:53.333 --> 00:55:55.700
LET'S DIG ONE OF THOSE
LITTLE GREASY TRUCK STOPS.

00:55:55.767 --> 00:55:58.733
I'D LIKE TO TALK WITH
THOSE TRUCK DRIVERS, YOU KNOW?

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.100
HEAR WHAT THEY GOT TO SAY
ABOUT LIFE ON THE ROAD.

00:56:19.333 --> 00:56:22.067
I BET THEY GOT
WILD STORIES OF THE ROAD.

00:56:22.133 --> 00:56:26.800
DRIVERS, TRUCKS, HIJACKERS!

00:56:26.867 --> 00:56:28.300
FIGHTS! LET'S DO IT.

00:56:28.367 --> 00:56:33.467
HERE'S A GOOD PLACE.

00:56:33.533 --> 00:56:37.600
I'LL HAVE YOUR DELUXE STEAK
WITH SALAD AND COFFEE. BLACK.

00:56:37.667 --> 00:56:38.600
ALL RIGHT.

00:56:38.667 --> 00:56:43.633
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE, SIR?

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:46.233
THAT WAS REALLY A FINE STEAK.

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:50.733
YOU CAN ALWAYS DEPEND
UPON HOWARD JOHNSON'S.

00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.633
LET'S GET BACK ON THE ROAD.

00:59:01.533 --> 00:59:03.433
GODDAMN.

00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:05.700
FRITZ! WAKE UP!

00:59:05.767 --> 00:59:07.167
HUH? WHAT?

00:59:07.233 --> 00:59:08.667
THE CAR IS BROKEN DOWN...

00:59:08.733 --> 00:59:10.367
AND I CAN'T GET
THE DAMNED THING...

00:59:10.433 --> 00:59:12.300
WHAT? WHERE ARE WE?

00:59:12.367 --> 00:59:13.700
FUCK A DUCK.

00:59:13.767 --> 00:59:16.267
WE'RE OUT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE FRIGGING DESERT.

00:59:16.333 --> 00:59:17.767
JESUS, IT'S GREAT!

00:59:17.833 --> 00:59:21.267
EXACTLY. YOU'VE BEEN
SOUND ASLEEP FOR TWO DAYS.

00:59:21.333 --> 00:59:23.300
-WHAT?
-TWO DAYS.

00:59:23.367 --> 00:59:26.333
YOU MUST'VE BEEN DRAGGED OUT
AFTER YOUR BIG BINGE.

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.433
SHIT. I GUESS I WAS.

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.800
ALL THAT DRINKING AND
BLOWING POT AND SCREWING, MAN.

00:59:31.867 --> 00:59:33.700
MAN, I GET HORNY
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.

00:59:33.767 --> 00:59:35.300
LIKE, WOW!

00:59:35.367 --> 00:59:38.367
START THINKING ABOUT
FIXING THIS CAR, FRITZ...

00:59:38.433 --> 00:59:41.800
OR WE'LL BE SITTING
HERE FOREVER.

00:59:41.867 --> 00:59:43.367
LOOK, IS SOMETHING
BUGGING YOU, PAL?

00:59:43.433 --> 00:59:48.800
YEAH, THE CAR WON'T GO!

00:59:48.867 --> 00:59:54.133
WELL, LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.400
I KNEW THAT ALL THE TIME.

00:59:55.467 --> 00:59:57.133
THE ENGINE'S NOT UP HERE,
IT'S IN THE BACK.

00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:59.533
LET'S JUST CHECK IT OUT.

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.800
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:00:00.867 --> 01:00:02.567
LET ME SEE, I'LL JUST...

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:04.333
IF I MOVE THAT...NO...

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.067
WHAT'S WRONG, FRITZ?

01:00:07.133 --> 01:00:08.300
IT'S ALL VERY COMPLICATED,
WINSTON.

01:00:08.367 --> 01:00:09.967
I COULDN'T BEGIN
TO EXPLAIN IT.

01:00:10.033 --> 01:00:12.800
I THINK THE PISTON ROD'S
STUCK IN THE DRIVE SHAFT.

01:00:12.867 --> 01:00:15.067
EITHER THAT,
OR THE CARBURETOR IS RUSTED OUT.

01:00:15.133 --> 01:00:20.333
OH, GOOD GOD.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.667
HERE COMES A PICKUP TRUCK.

01:00:21.733 --> 01:00:23.867
MAYBE HE'LL GIVE US A PUSH
TO THE NEXT GAS STATION.

01:00:27.767 --> 01:00:29.367
WHAT'S THE TROUBLE, BUDDY?

01:00:29.433 --> 01:00:30.733
OUR CAR IS BUSTED DOWN.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:35.433
COULD YOU GIVE US A PUSH
TO THE NEXT GAS STATION?

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.800
LET ME LOOK AT IT.

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:41.500
ONE THING I'M GOOD AT
IS FIXING THINGS.

01:00:41.567 --> 01:00:45.067
SHUT UP!

01:00:45.133 --> 01:00:47.567
PLEASE SHUT UP, CHICKENS!

01:00:47.633 --> 01:00:52.033
SHUT UP!

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.033
PLEASE SHUT UP!

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.833
I MEAN, SHUT UP!

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:04.533
ONE THING I'M GOOD AT...
IS FIXING THINGS.

01:01:07.067 --> 01:01:11.067
DUMB CHICKENS.

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:12.733
LET ME SEE NOW.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.167
AIN'T NOTHING THE MATTER
WITH THIS CAR HERE.

01:01:15.233 --> 01:01:17.467
BUDDY, AIN'T YOU GOT
ANY SENSE AT ALL?

01:01:17.533 --> 01:01:21.067
YOU JUST LET
YOUR CAR RUN OUT OF GAS.

01:01:21.067 --> 01:01:24.833
I SWEAR, THESE MOTHERFUCKING
HIPPIES FROM NEW YORK.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.867
THERE'S A GAS STATION
A COUPLE OF MILES BACK.

01:01:27.933 --> 01:01:29.800
I'M GOING THIS WAY.

01:01:29.867 --> 01:01:33.400
YOU OUGHT TO STOP FOR GAS
ONCE IN A WHILE, YOU STUPID...

01:01:33.467 --> 01:01:34.900
GOTTA KEEP YOUR ENGINE FED.

01:01:34.967 --> 01:01:38.067
WISE UP, BUDDY.

01:01:38.133 --> 01:01:40.267
WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:42.367
NEW YORK HIPPIES
COME DOWN HERE...

01:01:42.433 --> 01:01:43.667
AND THEY THINK THEY CAN...

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:45.200
I NEVER, HONEST AND TRUE.

01:01:45.267 --> 01:01:48.900
YOU THINK A THING
LIKE THAT HAPPENS...

01:01:48.967 --> 01:01:50.933
SON OF A BITCH.

01:01:51.067 --> 01:01:53.067
YOU'RE SO CLEVER.

01:01:53.133 --> 01:01:54.467
SO CLEVER.

01:01:54.533 --> 01:01:56.933
BIG MECHANICAL GENIUS.

01:01:57.067 --> 01:01:58.800
HERE'S A BUCKET, SMART GUY.

01:01:58.867 --> 01:02:00.233
GOOD LUCK.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.800
HEY, THIS IS FOR SHIT!

01:02:01.867 --> 01:02:03.567
YOU MADE A BIG BOURGEOIS DEAL
OUT OF EVERYTHING...

01:02:03.633 --> 01:02:06.533
AND RUINED IT COMPLETELY.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.733
I WAS GONNA BUG OUT AND BE FREE
FROM ALL THIS BULLSHIT...

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.167
AND ROAM AROUND
AND DIG EVERYTHING...

01:02:12.233 --> 01:02:14.367
AND REALLY HAVE A GOOD TIME.

01:02:14.433 --> 01:02:16.533
YOUR NAIVETÃ‰ IS ASTOUNDING.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.067
YOU'D BE COMPLETELY LOST
WITHOUT ME, FRITZ...

01:02:19.067 --> 01:02:20.300
AND YOU KNOW IT.

01:02:20.367 --> 01:02:21.767
YOU'RE A MOTHERFUCKING BITCH.

01:02:21.833 --> 01:02:23.433
I SEE THE HARD FACTS OF LIFE.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:28.067
I AM REALISTIC,
SOMETHING YOU'RE INCAPABLE OF.

01:02:28.067 --> 01:02:30.667
YOU'D BE BETTER OFF WITH
ONE OF THOSE STUPID MORONS...

01:02:30.733 --> 01:02:33.567
LIKE CHARLENE, WHO YOU COULD
SLEEP WITH AND THROW AWAY.

01:02:33.633 --> 01:02:36.200
YOU CAN'T COPE
WITH A MATURE WOMAN.

01:02:36.267 --> 01:02:38.633
YOU HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE...

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.967
THAT AN INTELLIGENT WOMAN...

01:02:40.067 --> 01:02:42.800
LOVES YOU AND WANTS TO
GIVE YOU SOMETHING OF VALUE...

01:02:42.867 --> 01:02:46.333
SOMETHING THAT WILL INFLAME
YOUR CREATIVE POTENTIAL!

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.333
NOW, GET GOING AND HURRY UP!

01:03:03.067 --> 01:03:06.267
WE'LL SEE WHO GETS LOST
WITHOUT WHOM.

01:03:06.333 --> 01:03:07.900
* FRITZ THE CAT
FRITZ THE CAT *

01:03:07.967 --> 01:03:09.967
* FRITZ THE CAT **

01:03:35.767 --> 01:03:38.900
* ME AND MY GAL
ARE RIDIN' AROUND *

01:03:38.967 --> 01:03:43.067
* I'M THE ENVY OF
EACH AND EVERY GUY IN TOWN *

01:03:43.133 --> 01:03:46.800
* SHE LOOKS SO SHARP,
AND MY GIRL DOES, TOO *

01:03:46.867 --> 01:03:52.133
* AND EVERYBODY KNOWS
WHAT I'M GONNA DO *

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.900
* GONNA TAKE A RIDE
ON MY BIKE *

01:03:55.967 --> 01:03:59.767
* GONNA TAKE IT
AND DRIVE ALL NIGHT *

01:03:59.833 --> 01:04:03.467
* TELL MY CHEVY
TO TAKE A HIKE *

01:04:03.533 --> 01:04:08.900
* TAKE ANOTHER RIDE
ON MY BIKE **

01:04:08.967 --> 01:04:11.100
BLUE, I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

01:04:27.533 --> 01:04:30.400
PENNILESS. A REGULAR BUM.

01:04:30.467 --> 01:04:33.267
A HOBO WITH NO MONEY
AND NO PLACE TO GO.

01:04:48.067 --> 01:04:50.500
HEY, YOU OLD SCROUNGY
OLD ALLEY CAT.

01:04:50.567 --> 01:04:52.133
GET OUT OF THEM GARBAGE CANS.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.433
YOU TALKING TO ME, JACK?

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.533
WHAT THE HELL
YOU DOING THERE, ANYWAY?

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.433
MAN, HERE WE ARE ON THE BRINK
OF THE APOCALYPSE...

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.200
THE EVE OF DESTRUCTION,
SO TO SPEAK...

01:05:02.267 --> 01:05:04.267
AND I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING TO DO.

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:07.867
OFFHAND, SON,
I'D SAY YOU HAVE GOT A PROBLEM.

01:05:07.933 --> 01:05:08.967
BUT AT LEAST YOU'RE HONEST.

01:05:09.067 --> 01:05:10.567
THE REVOLUTION
CAN USE A MAN LIKE YOU.

01:05:10.633 --> 01:05:13.300
-HOP ON.
-OKAY.

01:05:13.367 --> 01:05:14.600
-HELLO THERE.
-HI.

01:05:14.667 --> 01:05:16.200
-HOW ARE YOU?
-HIGH.

01:05:16.267 --> 01:05:18.767
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO THE GUYS
AT THE CELL MEETING.

01:05:56.867 --> 01:06:00.767
BLUE!
GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT, MAN.

01:06:00.833 --> 01:06:03.400
HOWDY, JOHN. I BROUGHT ALONG
AN OLD BUDDY OF MINE.

01:06:03.467 --> 01:06:06.200
HE'S A BRIGHT LAD
BUT BORED WITH LIFE.

01:06:06.267 --> 01:06:08.433
FRITZ...

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.700
THIS HERE IS JOHN...

01:06:10.767 --> 01:06:13.067
FORMER BIKER
AND SMALL-TIME HOOD...

01:06:13.067 --> 01:06:15.400
TURNED FIGHTER FOR THE CAUSE.

01:06:15.467 --> 01:06:17.267
THAT CAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL HEAD.

01:06:17.333 --> 01:06:18.767
GLAD TO MEET YOU, MAN.

01:06:18.833 --> 01:06:22.200
ANOTHER CAST OUT
FOR THE BOURGEOIS VIEW.

01:06:22.267 --> 01:06:25.500
FROM THE MOLD
OF BANKRUPT SEDENTARY.

01:06:25.567 --> 01:06:28.367
WHAT'S THE STATE OF
HIS POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS?

01:06:28.433 --> 01:06:33.200
PRACTICALLY NIL, I'M AFRAID.

01:06:33.267 --> 01:06:35.433
OUR SHIPMENT CAME IN TODAY.

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:38.267
THIRTY-TWO SURVIVED.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.967
GO AROUND.

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:52.867
HEY, CHIEF.

01:06:52.933 --> 01:06:57.067
WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT LITTLE
ACTION PLANNED FOR TONIGHT.

01:06:57.133 --> 01:07:00.067
WE'RE GONNA PARALYZE
THE WHOLE FUCKING CITY.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.200
IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT, MAN.

01:07:02.267 --> 01:07:04.833
THE SHIT IS REALLY
GONNA COME DOWN TONIGHT.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.433
WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED...

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:09.367
FOR THREE SYNCHRONIZED
SABOTAGE ACTIONS.

01:07:09.433 --> 01:07:10.900
THE CITY WILL BE OURS.

01:07:10.967 --> 01:07:12.267
THE MACHINERY
OF THE ESTABLISHMENT'S

01:07:12.333 --> 01:07:14.267
GONNA BE IN RUINS BY MORNING.

01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:17.500
THE GOVERNMENT WILL FALL
WITHOUT FIRING ONE GODDAMN SHOT.

01:07:17.567 --> 01:07:19.167
THE NEW MAYOR WILL RESIGN...

01:07:19.233 --> 01:07:22.333
AND WE'LL MOVE IN
AND SET UP A TRIBUNAL.

01:07:26.533 --> 01:07:28.567
IT'S CURTAINS.

01:07:28.633 --> 01:07:30.233
BLUE, HONEY,
TALK TO ME A MINUTE.

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.433
DON'T BOTHER ME.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:32.767
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU, HONEY.
LET'S GO.

01:07:32.833 --> 01:07:33.933
LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE.

01:07:34.067 --> 01:07:35.933
YOU AND ME, WE'LL GO
AND GET SOME CHINKS.

01:07:36.067 --> 01:07:36.933
I'M SO HUNGRY.

01:07:37.067 --> 01:07:37.967
I AIN'T HUNGRY.

01:07:38.067 --> 01:07:40.067
DON'T TURN OFF ON ME.

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:42.367
BESIDES...
YOU DON'T NEED THAT GARBAGE.

01:07:42.433 --> 01:07:45.867
EVERY TIME YOU'RE WITH
YOUR FRIENDS YOU DON'T PAY...

01:07:45.933 --> 01:07:46.867
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

01:07:46.933 --> 01:07:47.900
THAT HURT ME, GOD DAMN IT!

01:07:47.967 --> 01:07:50.567
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM,
A BOXING BALL?

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:53.600
A PUNCHING BAG!

01:07:53.667 --> 01:07:55.267
HIT HER! HIT HER!

01:07:55.333 --> 01:07:56.700
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS ARE?

01:07:56.767 --> 01:07:58.867
YOU'RE A BUNCH OF CLOSET FAGS.

01:07:58.933 --> 01:08:03.500
SHUT UP!

01:08:03.567 --> 01:08:05.067
AND WHEN I LEAVE THIS PLACE...

01:08:05.067 --> 01:08:07.400
YOU'LL GET TOGETHER
AND SCREW ONE ANOTHER.

01:08:07.467 --> 01:08:09.167
THAT'S NICE.
THAT IS NICE.

01:08:09.233 --> 01:08:12.067
SEE, SHE LOVES IT.

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:14.200
I LOVE IT, TOO.

01:08:14.267 --> 01:08:16.367
WE'VE GOT A LOT
OF LOUSY TIME TO KILL.

01:08:16.433 --> 01:08:18.900
TO ZERO HOUR.

01:08:18.967 --> 01:08:20.700
I THINK I'M GONNA RIDE
THAT GODDAMN HORSE.

01:08:20.767 --> 01:08:22.500
THEN GO ON, HAVE A GO.
YOU'LL LOVE IT.

01:08:22.567 --> 01:08:25.367
LET ME RIDE
THAT GODDAMN HORSE.

01:08:25.433 --> 01:08:26.333
GET ON WITH IT.

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.400
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE?

01:08:27.467 --> 01:08:31.533
YOU'RE A BUNCH
OF FUCKING NAZI FAGS!

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.533
GUYS, THAT'S UNCOOL.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.067
DON'T DO THAT.

01:08:34.133 --> 01:08:35.467
LISTEN, YOU SON OF A BITCH.

01:08:35.533 --> 01:08:39.100
YOU LOUSY...

01:08:39.167 --> 01:08:41.300
CUT IT OUT.
YOU'RE HURTING HER!

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:44.067
YOU MANIACS!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HER?

01:08:44.067 --> 01:08:49.200
GO AHEAD AND HIT ME!

01:08:49.267 --> 01:08:50.300
MY GOD, MY GOD!

01:08:50.367 --> 01:08:51.900
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:58.300
THIS ISN'T WORKING OUT, BLUE.

01:08:58.367 --> 01:09:01.333
OUR RELATIONSHIP STINKS.

01:09:24.067 --> 01:09:27.300
COME ON, HARRIET.
LET'S GO INSIDE, IT'S COLD.

01:09:27.367 --> 01:09:29.833
I HAVE TO GO TO BED BY DAY.

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.800
COME ON INSIDE, BABY,
YOU'LL GET HURT OUT HERE.

01:09:32.867 --> 01:09:35.333
LISTEN, I TRIED
TO STOP THEM, BUT ...

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:39.300
-COME ON, FRITZ!
-WAIT A MINUTE, HUH?

01:09:39.367 --> 01:09:41.067
JOHN SAYS
THIS NIGHT WILL MEAN...

01:09:41.133 --> 01:09:44.800
A GREAT LEAP FORWARD
FOR AMERICA'S SOCIAL EVOLUTION.

01:09:44.867 --> 01:09:50.767
DIG IT, WE'RE GONNA BLOW UP
THE POWER PLANT.

01:09:50.833 --> 01:09:51.833
THIS WILL KEEP YOU WARM.

01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:53.533
I GOTTA GO.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.000
HEY, BABY.

01:10:08.067 --> 01:10:09.967
WE ALL HAD A GOOD TIME TODAY
AND GOT OUR ROCKS OFF.

01:10:14.367 --> 01:10:17.600
NOW WE MUST DEVOTE OURSELVES
TO THE GREAT TASK BEFORE US.

01:10:35.733 --> 01:10:37.267
WHAT'D YOU HAVE
TO HIT HER SO HARD FOR?

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:38.900
SHE LOVED IT.

01:10:38.967 --> 01:10:40.733
ME AND YOU HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED
TO BLOW UP THE POWER PLANT.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.233
THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:45.300
THE REVOLUTION.

01:10:45.367 --> 01:10:46.967
YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT!

01:10:47.033 --> 01:10:48.133
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT...
IS A REASON TO HURT,

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.433
TO DESTROY, TO BLOW UP.

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.733
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
A REAL REVOLUTION IS.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.867
NONE OF YOU SONS OF BITCHES DO.

01:11:13.567 --> 01:11:19.100
HARRIET, WELL, SHE'S GOOD.

01:11:19.167 --> 01:11:23.133
SHE'S REAL. SHE LOVES.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.500
SHE LOVES.

01:11:24.567 --> 01:11:25.700
AND WHEN YOU GET
RIGHT DOWN TO IT...

01:11:25.767 --> 01:11:27.333
THAT'S WHERE IT'S REALLY AT.

01:11:32.867 --> 01:11:37.067
THE LOVE YOU GIVE IS EQUAL
TO THE LOVE YOU GET.

01:11:37.133 --> 01:11:38.067
WELL, FUCK IT.

01:11:38.067 --> 01:11:39.300
I AIN'T DOING IT.

01:11:39.367 --> 01:11:41.300
SO LONG, FRITZ.

01:11:41.367 --> 01:11:43.867
I AIN'T PLANTING THIS BOMB
FOR YOU SCHMUCKS.

01:12:10.267 --> 01:12:11.433
FAR OUT.

01:13:30.767 --> 01:13:34.367
AND THOUGH AFTER MY SKIN WORMS
DESTROY THIS BODY...

01:13:34.433 --> 01:13:37.500
YET IN MY FLESH
SHALL I SEE GOD...

01:13:37.567 --> 01:13:40.400
WHOM I SHALL SEE
FOR MYSELF.

01:13:40.467 --> 01:13:42.833
FRITZ! YOU GOTTA
LET US SEE OUR FRITZ!

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.700
WHERE IS HE?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HIM?

01:13:44.767 --> 01:13:46.267
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE,
YOU JUST CAN'T.

01:13:46.333 --> 01:13:47.533
I'M SORRY, GIRLS.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.700
-HE'S UNDER HOUSE ARREST.
-LET US SEE HIM ! PLEASE!

01:13:49.767 --> 01:13:51.100
-NO ONE GETS IN.
-HE'S HURT.

01:13:51.167 --> 01:13:52.833
LORD JESUS...

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.600
AND SHALT BELIEVE
IN THINE HEART...

01:13:54.667 --> 01:13:59.867
THAT GOD HATH RAISED HIM
FROM THE DEAD.

01:14:00.067 --> 01:14:01.767
I RECKON HE, UH...

01:14:01.833 --> 01:14:03.633
HE MUST BE THROUGH.

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:09.400
FINISHED.

01:14:09.467 --> 01:14:10.833
FOR WITH THE HEART...

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:13.300
MAN BELIEVETH
UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS...

01:14:13.367 --> 01:14:14.300
AND WITH THE MOUTH...

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:17.733
CONFESSION
IS MADE UNTO SALVATION.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.267
HE THAT COVERETH HIS SINS
SHALL NOT PROSPER...

01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:24.933
BUT WHOSO CONFESSETH
AND FORSAKETH THEM...

01:14:25.067 --> 01:14:27.467
SHALL HAVE MERCY.

01:14:27.533 --> 01:14:29.333
FRITZ, WE'RE SO SORRY, BABY.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:48.967
HE'S TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING.

01:14:53.533 --> 01:14:56.467
I'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN...

01:14:56.533 --> 01:15:02.333
THE FOUR CORNERS...
OF THIS BIG OLD WORLD.

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:08.467
I'VE...SEEN IT ALL...
AND I'VE DONE IT ALL.

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:15.833
I'VE FOUGHT MANY A GOOD MAN...

01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:20.067
AND I'VE LAID MANY A GOOD WOMAN.

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:22.533
AND...

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:27.167
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I'VE LEARNED...

01:15:27.233 --> 01:15:30.433
IT'S...IT'S...

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:31.733
YOU GET OVER HERE...

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.200
AND YOU GET
DOWN THERE LIKE THAT...

01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:59.200
POOR CAT.

01:15:59.267 --> 01:16:02.733
HE WAS A...
HE WAS A TOUGH KID

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.500
AT THAT, WASN'T HE?

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:23.067
* DOWN THE LANE
THEY'RE STROLLING *

01:16:23.133 --> 01:16:28.067
* TWO BY TWO *

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:31.533
* HOLDING HANDS *

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.333
* THEY SMILE LIKE
WE USED TO DO *

01:16:38.367 --> 01:16:44.067
* HERE WITH THEIR
ONE AND ONLY *

01:16:44.067 --> 01:16:49.333
* I'D FORGOTTEN
I WAS LONELY *

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:54.333
* OH, HOW I WISH
THAT HERE WERE THERE WITH YOU *

01:16:59.433 --> 01:17:05.433
* ALL THE DAYS OF SADNESS
THEY SEEM SO NEEDLESS NOW *

01:17:09.233 --> 01:17:14.933
* YES, IT'S TAKEN ME
THIS LONG, LONG TIME *

01:17:15.067 --> 01:17:19.633
* TO SEE
IT'S CLEAR *

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:25.633
* AND MY DREAMS
KEEP DRIFTING BACK TO ME *

01:17:29.533 --> 01:17:35.467
* AND OUR STROLLS BENEATH THESE
SAME STARS ABOVE *

01:17:39.567 --> 01:17:44.667
* AND WHEN THE LEAVES
ARE FALLING *

01:17:45.667 --> 01:17:51.067
* MY HEART WILL BE RECALLING *

01:17:51.067 --> 01:17:57.067
* YOU'RE THE ONLY GIRL
I EVER REALLY LOVED *
