Radio Moscow.
Director Andreyev. What is it?

3
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.879
Seventeen minutes.

4
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.600
Yes, of course I can ring back
in 17 minutes.

5
00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.560
Yeah.

6
00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.719
Mm-hm.
Yes, I'm writing it down.

7
00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:05.478
I can't get the...

8
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.600
One, five...

9
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.159
Sorry? Was that a nine, as in "fine"?

10
00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.000
Or... or another five as in, um...

11
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.159
- "Hive."
- ..."hive"?

12
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.520
Hello? Hello?

13
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.317
- Hive?
- Who was it?

14
00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.518
The Secretariat
of the General Secretariat.

15
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.518
Of the General Secretary.
The Secretary of the General...

16
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.640
Stalin?

17
00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.917
Turn that down.

18
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.437
Put that apple down.

19
00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.197
You're always eating bloody apples.

20
00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.398
I'm to call him back
in 17 minutes.

21
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.197
Seventeen minutes from when
you picked up the phone

22
00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.317
or from when you put it down?

23
00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.358
Seventeen minutes from when I said
I'd call back in 17 minutes.

24
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.360
- When was that?
- I don't know.

25
00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:56.159
Thirty seconds ago?

26
00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.197
- A minute?
- Well, which one?

27
00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:00.317
- A minute.
- A minute?

28
00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.400
A minute.

29
00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.917
- You sure?
- No.

30
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.320
Well, well, well.

31
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.678
Oh, I put Shteyman
on the list, the writer.

32
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.278
- I know you like his work, but...
- No, leave him on.

33
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.518
And, uh... Shteyman two, his wife?

34
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.560
On.

35
00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.359
They're a couple, ain't they?

36
00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.317
We're talking about Stalingrad,
how cold it was,

37
00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.998
and we would do anything,
anything, to warm ourselves up.

38
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.877
We'd throw live grenades
to each other.

39
00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.197
We'd pull the pin,
throw it to the prisoners.

40
00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:39.437
They'd be jumping around
like drunken whores. "Oh, oh, oh!"

41
00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.599
What was the grenade?

42
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.877
- A grenade.
- Georgy.

43
00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.637
- A grenade... what do you...
- No no no.

44
00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.559
You're obstructing the story.
Let him tell it.

45
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.759
So, ten past, the call came in.

46
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.800
- Seventeen minutes...
- So call back 10:27?

47
00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.597
- Yeah.
- You don't seem confident.

48
00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.358
Well, I wasn't the one
on the phone.

49
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.917
And it was definitely a nine,
wasn't it?

50
00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.518
- I wasn't the one on the phone.
- You keep saying that.

51
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.918
- It's not helping.
- I wasn't, though. So...

52
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.517
A grenade in his mouth!

53
00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:22.437
- Always cracks me up, this one.
- And then boom!

54
00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:23.757
I'll have these dispatched.

55
00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.839
That's how you turn a Prussian
into a bowl of soup.

56
00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.437
Oh, there he goes.

57
00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.199
Yes, we see your list, Beria.

58
00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.437
Shoot her before him,
but make sure he sees it.

59
00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:38.079
Oh, and this one... um...

60
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.600
Kill him, take him to his church,
dump him in the pulpit.

61
00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.240
And I'll leave the rest
up to you.

62
00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.199
Let's go!

63
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.718
First three names on list.
Top name, apartment 15. Go.

64
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.880
Go, go.

65
00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:35.000
Come on. Where are you going?
Get round here. Get on the bus.

66
00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:39.437
Comrade, it's the greatest honour.

67
00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.000
He can't see me bow.

68
00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.519
- Comrade Director.
- Oh, shit.

69
00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.839
Five... nine.

70
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.280
Hello.

71
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.197
This is Stalin.

72
00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.877
Bravo!

73
00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:03.038
Sorry. It's really noisy.
I'm sorry about that.

74
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.678
How are you?
How is it wherever you are?

75
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.197
Sorry. Sorry again.

76
00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.120
- Are you there?
- Receiving you.

77
00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.478
I want a recording
of tonight's performance.

78
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.920
I'll send someone to pick it up.

79
00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.918
I think you split
a couple of notes.

80
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.478
You cheeky bugger. I did not.

81
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.317
- How was it? Was it good?
- I thought wonderful.

82
00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.800
Was the concerto recorded?

83
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.358
Was it recorded? Please say yes.

84
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.358
- Erm... no. It went out live.
- Stay. Stay.

85
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.678
Okay, nobody leave! Nobody leave!
Lock the doors! Lock those doors!

86
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.437
If you wouldn't mind
just taking your seats again.

87
00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:37.598
That would be fantastic.

88
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.358
Take your seats.
Take your fucking seats.

89
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.197
Don't worry, nobody's
gonna get killed, I promise you.

90
00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:46.038
This is just
a musical emergency.

91
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.397
Take your seats. That's it.

92
00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:49.038
Nobody be alarmed. It's fine.

93
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.637
Sit down! Do not defy me!

94
00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:53.319
Sit your arses down!

95
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.197
Top me up. Everybody drinks.

96
00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.598
As I was saying,
we had this 12-year-old scout.

97
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.637
His whole family
was wiped out by the Krauts.

98
00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.718
But before that he taught us
this trick. He taught us this trick.

99
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.478
He taught us this trick.
If you stick somebody's little finger

100
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.757
in a glass of water
while they're sleeping,

101
00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.077
they wet themselves.

102
00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:16.077
Here, what next?

103
00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:17.558
You stick a bar of chocolate

104
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.277
in their pocket,
they shit their pants?

105
00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:27.397
But it's biology, Chief.
We did it to Polnikov in Stalingrad.

106
00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:29.718
But, anyway,
"shit your pants", that's great.

107
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.317
Whatever became of Polnikov?

108
00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.639
You wanna know
where fucking Polnikov is?

109
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.879
You wanna go there?

110
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.120
I love that grenade story.

111
00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:48.038
- Oh, is there one in your pocket?
- No, no, come on. No, not again!

112
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.437
No, don't you...

113
00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:52.757
God damn it!

114
00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:55.317
Caught red-handed.

115
00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:57.478
Well, I would die for the Motherland!

116
00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:02.519
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

117
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.560
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

118
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.120
Take this, you bastards!

119
00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:28.718
All right, let's get going.

120
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.560
Time for a cowboy movie.
Who's in my posse?

121
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.519
Here we go. He rides out,
he gets shot off his horse.

122
00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:42.199
Adios.

123
00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:45.677
Thank you very much.
It's gonna be okay.

124
00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:46.799
Sit where you sat before.

125
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.598
Right, what do you think?

126
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.480
Well, half the audience have gone.
The acoustic will be very lively.

127
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.757
Go and get some more people
in off the street.

128
00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:57.797
Fat ones, so we don't need as many.

129
00:08:57.799 --> 00:09:00.157
Really? How fat?

130
00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:03.598
I could get my wife.
She'd deaden the acoustic.

131
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.360
Comrades...
Comrades, shut up!

132
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.557
I have wonderful news.

133
00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:11.757
Comrade Stalin
loved tonight's concerto

134
00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:14.318
and would like
a recording of it right away,

135
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.078
which we don't have, for reasons
that are myriad and complex and...

136
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:24.438
But meanwhile the concerto
we just played will be played again.

137
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.520
And this time we will record it
and we will applaud it.

138
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.320
Yes. Yes.

139
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.920
Brilliant. Okay.

140
00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:52.039
Excuse me.

141
00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:53.720
I won't do it.

142
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.600
Come on, through here.
In you come.

143
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.320
Sit down. Sit down.

144
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.637
You, Joan of Arc,
do you want to get killed?

145
00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:07.799
Like my father got killed,
my brother? Like that?

146
00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:12.279
- But they would want you to live.
- I won't do it. You can't force me.

147
00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:15.198
- Can't we just get another pianist?
- That would be ridiculous.

148
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.118
The sound would be
completely different.

149
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.917
- Even Stalin could...
- Even?

150
00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:21.637
- I didn't mean...
- Even Stalin?

151
00:10:21.639 --> 00:10:23.120
I hope this office isn't bugged.

152
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.677
Of course Comrade Stalin would
be able to tell the difference.

153
00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:30.118
He's a great man with a great ear.

154
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.917
- Two great ears.
- Sharp. They're sharp.

155
00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:36.637
- The sharpest ears in the...
- In the Soviet Union.

156
00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:39.557
Maria Veniaminovna,
you have to play.

157
00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:41.598
I didn't...
I didn't mean what I said.

158
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.759
So you said it, then?

159
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:48.080
As God is my witness, I won't do it.
The Lord will see me through.

160
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.720
10,000 roubles.

161
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.280
20,000.

162
00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.279
Done. Let's go.

163
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.517
Ohh!

164
00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:05.757
What the fuck?

165
00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:10.919
What fucking brainless fire-safety
fucking idiot put that there?

166
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.600
Now we need a new conductor.
Let's go.

167
00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:24.000
Which one's your father in?

168
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.879
Thank you. You've been very helpful.
Follow me.

169
00:11:29.799 --> 00:11:31.039
Open up!

170
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.277
Let's get these on the bus.

171
00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:36.797
Keep it moving!
We've still got things to do!

172
00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:38.078
Come on, move!

173
00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:53.277
I love you. I love you.

174
00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:56.399
Now, you say whatever
you have to say to them. You say it.

175
00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:58.120
Oh, God.

176
00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:00.879
Hello. Hi.

177
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.917
Deepest apologies, sir.

178
00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:05.438
Radio Moscow requests your
presence immediately, please.

179
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.920
You're Moscow's finest and nearest
conductor, so... we must hurry.

180
00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:19.838
I rather enjoyed your reference
to Polnikov this evening.

181
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.478
Stalin looked like he was
gonna split your head open.

182
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.318
"What became of Polnikov and
Trotsky? I was a huge fan of his."

183
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.998
"I miss the Tsar."

184
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.078
I'm exhausted. I can't remember
who's alive and who isn't.

185
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.637
Georgy, when you go home,
make sure your wife writes down

186
00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:36.598
everything you think
you said tonight.

187
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.998
All right, this way in the morning
you know what you're dealing with.

188
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.517
That's Khrushchev's Law.

189
00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:43.679
Good night, comrades. Long live
the Communist Party of Lenin-Stalin.

190
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.037
Long live John Wayne
and John Ford.

191
00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:50.277
Goodbye, Molotov, old friend.

192
00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:51.399
Goodbye forever.

193
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.560
Yeah. On the list.

194
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.797
It would be simpler and cheaper

195
00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:58.439
if they just drove
straight into a river.

196
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.240
Sweet dreams.

197
00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:05.120
Good night.

198
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.320
Night.

199
00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:21.037
People in off the streets.

200
00:13:21.039 --> 00:13:22.159
Just this way.

201
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.400
I don't think any of these people
have ever heard of Mozart.

202
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.877
I made a joke about the farmers.

203
00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:59.360
- Did Stalin laugh?
- Yeah.

204
00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:03.438
I made a joke about the navy.

205
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.840
- No laugh.
- No more navy jokes.

206
00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:07.557
Good evening.

207
00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:09.397
Get this lot checked in.

208
00:14:09.399 --> 00:14:10.557
Good. Nice.

209
00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:12.399
Long live Stalin!

210
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.440
Long live Stalin!

211
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.759
- Shouldn't we check it?
- No time.

212
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.157
If it's not okay, then Stalin's men
will chop you into dog meat.

213
00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:50.159
Thank you.

214
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.877
Move, move, move, move, move.
Excuse me. Thank you.

215
00:14:53.879 --> 00:14:55.600
I have it. I have it.

216
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:03.838
I have the recording. I just had to
get a new sleeve, a white one.

217
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.557
The delay has been logged.

218
00:15:05.559 --> 00:15:08.358
I wish to convey a special
message from my heart.

219
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.358
I wish to convey this recording
to Comrade Stalin.

220
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.198
I want Comrade Stalin to know

221
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.520
the full intensity
of my feelings for him.

222
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.877
No, this is unauthorised narcissism.

223
00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:19.039
No.

224
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.198
The item is now in my possession...
after a significant delay.

225
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.440
Note the time.

226
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.680
What took you so long?
You fucking walk here?

227
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.438
Josef Vissarionovich Stalin,

228
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.280
you have betrayed our nation
and destroyed its people.

229
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.198
I pray for your end,
and ask the Lord to forgive you.

230
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.637
Tyrant.

231
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.200
Oh, fuck. Fuck...

232
00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:50.557
Should we investigate?

233
00:16:50.559 --> 00:16:53.599
Should you shut the fuck up
before you get us both killed?

234
00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:06.119
Good morning.

235
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.799
Well?

236
00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:16.240
Comrade Stalin?

237
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.037
Comrade Stalin?

238
00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.679
I just need some names.

239
00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:27.357
Each name you give me
is one less bit of you I'll cut off.

240
00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.359
Enter.

241
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.240
Sorry to interrupt, Comrade Minister.
It's Comrade Stalin.

242
00:17:36.759 --> 00:17:39.440
Oh, don't worry about him.
Those ears are full of blood anyway.

243
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.360
Comrade Stalin is very ill.

244
00:17:43.079 --> 00:17:44.199
Very ill?

245
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.000
Yes.

246
00:17:47.319 --> 00:17:48.439
Uh-huh.

247
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.597
- You, carry on.
- Of course.

248
00:17:53.279 --> 00:17:56.240
Tell them Beria is on his way.

249
00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.600
They are to touch nothing,
call no-one. Understood?

250
00:18:02.359 --> 00:18:04.438
Tell me you understand
my instructions.

251
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.638
I understand your instructions.

252
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.117
Good.

253
00:18:08.119 --> 00:18:10.919
Shh, shh.

254
00:18:11.519 --> 00:18:13.039
What's your name, Lieutenant?

255
00:18:14.599 --> 00:18:16.158
S-Slimonov, sir.

256
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.560
S-Slimonov?

257
00:18:18.759 --> 00:18:20.559
Be here when I g-get back.

258
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.440
Long live Stalin!

259
00:18:28.519 --> 00:18:31.718
- Abramovsky still holding out?
- Yeah. He's close, though.

260
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.478
He was close yesterday.

261
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.837
Long live Stalin!

262
00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:36.557
Have his wife move into the next cell

263
00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:38.277
and start working
on her until he talks.

264
00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:39.757
Make it noisy.

265
00:18:39.759 --> 00:18:43.000
Shame. Mrs Abramovsky's been
most cooperative so far.

266
00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:47.238
Some women will do anything
to get their husbands released.

267
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.438
Yeah, and she did everything.

268
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.478
I thank the Union for bringing me
so many devoted wives

269
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.440
who fuck like sewing machines.

270
00:18:54.839 --> 00:18:56.117
Glasses.

271
00:18:58.599 --> 00:19:00.359
To his dacha. Urgently.

272
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.357
Tanks, farmers, navy,

273
00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:11.878
grenade: funny.

274
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.998
Beria, tomato, pocket: funny. Horse...

275
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.837
- Funny?
- ...slippers: question mark.

276
00:19:16.839 --> 00:19:19.597
- Farmers, horse again, navy...
- There were no whores.

277
00:19:19.599 --> 00:19:23.317
What are you writing?
Oh, "horse". Is this in code?

278
00:19:23.319 --> 00:19:25.878
This is your drunken nonsense,
not mine. Don't blame my notes.

279
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.557
"Molotov C-H-H-H..."

280
00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:30.277
Was I stuttering? What is that?

281
00:19:30.279 --> 00:19:31.920
Molotov...

282
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.759
Oh. It's Molotov...

283
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.160
- He's on the list.
- Poor Molotov.

284
00:19:39.759 --> 00:19:41.480
First his wife, now him.

285
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.600
Georgy is off in a hurry somewhere.

286
00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:46.239
Something's happening.

287
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.119
Hello?

288
00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:50.678
What?

289
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.158
Get my trousers.

290
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.438
Just get my... No, not you.

291
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.398
Who's there? Is Beria there?

292
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.840
Never mind. I'll be right there.

293
00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:00.517
Your trousers. Your trousers.
Here are your trousers.

294
00:20:00.519 --> 00:20:02.200
- Okay, okay.
- Let me take your pyjamas.

295
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.037
No, there's no time. Get my
shoes, please, Nina, my shoes.

296
00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:08.000
- Your shirt.
- Send me a shirt and tie.

297
00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:27.918
Were you on duty
when he was found?

298
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.597
- Yes, sir.
- No-one is to come in. Understood?

299
00:20:30.599 --> 00:20:32.077
Yes, sir.

300
00:20:32.079 --> 00:20:33.480
Remain at your stations.

301
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.880
Oh, God.

302
00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:45.478
They told me
not to get a doctor.

303
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.077
You did well, Matryona Petrovna.

304
00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:49.198
The Central Committee
will handle things now.

305
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.840
- So they'll get a doctor?
- There are procedures in place.

306
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.200
- So you'll get a doctor?
- I am the doctor.

307
00:20:56.319 --> 00:20:57.879
I'll see to everything. Come on.

308
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.440
Go on. He'll be fine.

309
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.559
Smells like a Baku pisshouse in here.

310
00:21:10.599 --> 00:21:11.639
Greetings, by the way.

311
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.119
Oh, shit.

312
00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:23.639
Uh-huh.

313
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.039
Oh, come on. Fuck!

314
00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.680
Khrustalyov! Khrustalyov!

315
00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:12.678
- Take the papers.
- Let them go.

316
00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.678
Take the papers or I'll cut
your eyes out one at a time

317
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.037
so you can watch it happening!

318
00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:17.359
- Drop it.
- Take them!

319
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.600
Come in.

320
00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:50.200
Oh, my God.

321
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.198
Is this...
I'm guessing that this is...

322
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.759
Yeah, he's feeling unwell, clearly.

323
00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:03.878
He's irreplaceable.

324
00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:08.599
How can we possibly...

325
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.918
All right, we must
think of the people.

326
00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:16.998
As Acting General Secretary,
I must step up.

327
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.198
I must... I must take his place
while he's... on the floor.

328
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.158
But you just said
he's irreplaceable.

329
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.158
Irreplaceable. Take his place as in

330
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.037
assembling the Central Committee,
of course.

331
00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:31.879
Good. I was testing you.
Get used to that sort of challenge.

332
00:23:33.559 --> 00:23:35.039
So, what next, boss?

333
00:23:36.599 --> 00:23:38.559
We should...
We should get a doctor.

334
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.559
Yeah...

335
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.878
Yes. If only we hadn't...

336
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.077
put away all those highly
competent doctors for treason.

337
00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:46.837
- You remember?
- Yes, I do. I do.

338
00:23:46.839 --> 00:23:49.158
You know,
they were plotting to poison him.

339
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.077
Yes, that's right.
You collected the evidence.

340
00:23:51.079 --> 00:23:53.878
Yes, I did. I did.
Are you still testing me?

341
00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.520
Oh, this is calamity!

342
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.837
Calamity!

343
00:24:03.839 --> 00:24:06.199
Ah! Ohh...

344
00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:08.757
Oh.

345
00:24:08.759 --> 00:24:10.879
Oh-oh-oh, no!

346
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.998
Oh, he's on the floor.
He's on the fucking floor!

347
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.757
Okay, be careful, careful.

348
00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:21.277
Oh, what to do? Oh, what to do?

349
00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:23.559
My heart, it feels sick...

350
00:24:25.519 --> 00:24:27.277
like it's going into battle.

351
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.797
Which doctor have you called?

352
00:24:39.799 --> 00:24:41.797
Well, the subject's currently
under discussion.

353
00:24:41.799 --> 00:24:43.277
As Acting General Secretary,

354
00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:45.757
I think that, well,
the Committee should decide.

355
00:24:45.759 --> 00:24:47.158
The Committee?

356
00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.198
But our actual General Secretary
is lying in a puddle of indignity.

357
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.478
I mean, I think he's saying,
"Get me a doctor now."

358
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.757
No, I don't agree. I think
we should wait until we're quorate.

359
00:24:57.759 --> 00:25:01.198
Quorate? The room
is only 75 percent conscious!

360
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.438
- Are you wearing pyjamas?
- Yeah. So?

361
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.200
- Why?
- Because I act, Lavrenti.

362
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.238
Decisively and with great speed.

363
00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.557
I said you'd be tested

364
00:25:10.559 --> 00:25:13.158
and now you're being tested
by a shouting man in pyjamas.

365
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.837
Have you got a nappy
under those too? Too late for him.

366
00:25:15.839 --> 00:25:19.039
Out of my way, you fannies.

367
00:25:24.119 --> 00:25:25.119
Shit.

368
00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:30.718
Where's the big fella?

369
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.319
Are we late?

370
00:25:33.759 --> 00:25:35.160
Sorry.

371
00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:39.478
He can't go, not like this.

372
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.438
- Careful. Careful.
- Whoa, whoa.

373
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.198
It's wet.

374
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.478
- So, was Beria here first?
- Yeah, what do you think?

375
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.638
This can't be happening.
This can't be fucking...

376
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.678
No, that's wet. For God's sake.

377
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.158
You got here quick, comrade.

378
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.158
I didn't stop to put on cologne.

379
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.918
Hey, watch the suit. Watch the suit.

380
00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.718
Compelling drama, gentlemen,
but we do need to get him into bed.

381
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.238
- You take the head.
- Why?

382
00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.599
- You're Acting General Secretary.
- I would be honoured.

383
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.277
It's just me here
kneeling in the piss, yeah?

384
00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:08.878
- Why don't you...
- But, there's piss...

385
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.398
- Come on.
- It is better. It's more balanced.

386
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.280
Yeah? Well, you can pay
my laundry bill, then.

387
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.718
You're not auditioning
for the Bolshoi.

388
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.357
- Who are you, Nijinsky? Come on.
- I have a bad back.

389
00:26:19.359 --> 00:26:21.238
Too much social climbing, I expect.

390
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.238
- The head is the heaviest part.
- All right, ready?

391
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.198
- Three, two...
- Two.

392
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.240
One.

393
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.480
Lift. Jesus.

394
00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:32.837
- God.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

395
00:26:32.839 --> 00:26:34.837
- To me.
- Turn, turn, turn.

396
00:26:34.839 --> 00:26:37.398
- This way. There we go.
- Yeah, all right.

397
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.757
Are you wearing pyjamas?

398
00:26:38.759 --> 00:26:40.438
Can we just stop twittering

399
00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.478
like fishwives at the market
and concentrate?

400
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.878
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Open the door. Back up, back up.

401
00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.357
No, no, that way.

402
00:26:47.359 --> 00:26:49.757
Go. Right, go.

403
00:26:49.759 --> 00:26:51.398
- Get back to the kitchen now!
- Move!

404
00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.600
- Move!
- Now. Now.

405
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.357
He's heavier than I thought he'd be.

406
00:26:55.359 --> 00:26:58.438
- Do you think Stalin's too heavy?
- No, it's a compliment.

407
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.077
- Gold is heavy.
- Well, you'd know.

408
00:27:00.079 --> 00:27:02.277
You've looted enough of it,
you saucy little pirate.

409
00:27:02.279 --> 00:27:04.160
Get back in the dining room!

410
00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.478
- Right, this one. This way, this way.
- Stop using his feet.

411
00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.277
- I'm sorry.
- Can we just put him down?

412
00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:11.718
- I'm absolutely soaked.
- Lamp. Lamp, lamp.

413
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.198
- Out of the way.
- No, wait a minute... move, move.

414
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.317
Mikoyan,
move out of the way, quickly.

415
00:27:16.319 --> 00:27:19.198
- I can't, I can't.
- Fucking hell!

416
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.918
- Fuck. Jesus Christ!
- Turn him over.

417
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.440
Fuck me! Three fittings
I had for this suit. Three.

418
00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.557
He looks ready now.

419
00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:32.357
- I need a vodka.
- I need a wash.

420
00:27:32.359 --> 00:27:35.198
But we didn't drop him.
Well done, us.

421
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.597
Oh, I still got fucking tomato
in my pocket.

422
00:27:38.599 --> 00:27:40.039
It's still funny.

423
00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:43.678
All right, comrades,
now that we're quorate,

424
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.438
I propose we call a doctor.

425
00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:49.158
All the best doctors
are in the gulag, or dead.

426
00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.037
Yes, yes, because they tried
to kill the boss.

427
00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:56.718
So any doctor still in Moscow
is not a good doctor.

428
00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.878
What are people's thoughts
on getting a bad doctor?

429
00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.757
What the fuck are you
talking about? That's mad.

430
00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:07.678
What if he recovers
and finds out?

431
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.718
Well, if he recovers,
then we got a good doctor,

432
00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.440
and if he doesn't recover,
then we didn't, but he won't know.

433
00:28:14.119 --> 00:28:15.678
What was the name of the...

434
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.120
that woman who gave evidence
against the doctors?

435
00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.597
- Timashuk.
- Yes.

436
00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:23.277
She's got everything
we require for the situation.

437
00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:26.317
The location of all the remaining
doctors in the Moscow area,

438
00:28:26.319 --> 00:28:30.557
a proven desire to survive
and a talent for fellatio.

439
00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:32.438
Yeah, right, she gets my vote.

440
00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.998
Good. Let her find us
some doctors.

441
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.878
Yeah, and if it goes badly,
we pin it all on Lady Suck Suck.

442
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.158
- Then we shoot her.
- Yes, that would work.

443
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.517
You see? We're better as a committee.

444
00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:45.559
Let's go.

445
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.880
You have a nice long sleep, old man.

446
00:29:13.519 --> 00:29:14.680
I'll take it from here.

447
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.240
That's him.
That's him there. There.

448
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.317
Please, I've done nothing wrong.

449
00:30:02.319 --> 00:30:03.438
Take the stethoscope.

450
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.597
Comrade Timashuk,
I retired six years ago.

451
00:30:06.599 --> 00:30:08.319
- Get that coat on him.
- Please, I...

452
00:30:08.759 --> 00:30:10.438
Look,
I can give you names.

453
00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.238
- Come on. Stop resisting.
- What about my dog?

454
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.839
- This is appalling.
- Hurry up.

455
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.559
Get him in the van.

456
00:30:18.359 --> 00:30:19.919
We found some old friends of yours.

457
00:30:20.599 --> 00:30:22.559
I've never met them
before in my life.

458
00:30:29.119 --> 00:30:31.158
So, Molotov's off the list.

459
00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.640
Yes, Beria's moving fast.

460
00:30:34.519 --> 00:30:36.277
But we can still outvote him.

461
00:30:36.279 --> 00:30:41.117
I always thought it would be you,
to fill Stalin's shoes, if I'm honest.

462
00:30:41.119 --> 00:30:42.439
Not Malenkov.

463
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.800
Who knows the future
of the Union?

464
00:30:48.799 --> 00:30:51.639
Well, the Union
could really use change.

465
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.597
Maybe some reforms
now that the old man...

466
00:30:54.599 --> 00:30:56.240
No, Nicky.

467
00:30:56.839 --> 00:30:59.039
Nobody needs factionalism.

468
00:31:00.039 --> 00:31:01.718
You want factionalism?

469
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.597
What about those two, fucking
Abbott and Costello over there?

470
00:31:04.599 --> 00:31:06.238
Christ.

471
00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.597
When I piss, I try to make
eye contact with an officer.

472
00:31:09.599 --> 00:31:10.839
Ruins their day.

473
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.720
When I piss, I try to piss
on an officer. Also ruins their day.

474
00:31:15.839 --> 00:31:17.918
We should keep an eye
on Kaganovich.

475
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.317
Yeah, Khrushchev too,
his talking goat.

476
00:31:20.319 --> 00:31:23.757
Khrushchev. I spend my life
making people talk.

477
00:31:23.759 --> 00:31:26.279
I can't shut that gabbling idiot up.

478
00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:30.678
We need to assert our authority,
increase security in Moscow.

479
00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.638
We should get
Stalin's children here.

480
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.998
Vasily will be lying face down
in a ditch full of vodka.

481
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.638
- But Svetlana...
- The people love her.

482
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.998
- I'm gonna get her in.
- Comrade ministers!

483
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.077
- Svetlana is here!
- I'm here. I'm over here!

484
00:31:45.079 --> 00:31:47.277
- Svetlana!
- Svetlana!

485
00:31:47.279 --> 00:31:49.077
Shit. The race has started.

486
00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:52.718
All right, we need to start putting
together a plan. We need change.

487
00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.998
Put a halt to the arrests,
prison releases,

488
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.517
maybe even reform the Church.

489
00:31:56.519 --> 00:31:58.638
How can you run and plot
at the same time?

490
00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.918
Hello! Svetlana!

491
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.638
- They're trying to cut you off.
- Where?

492
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.398
It's obvious. Svetlana!

493
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.918
- Svetlana!
- Svetlana!

494
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.077
- Oh, my darling.
- Where is he?

495
00:32:07.079 --> 00:32:09.317
- Where's my father? I would like...
- Oh, my dear.

496
00:32:09.319 --> 00:32:12.238
- I'm so sorry.
- I would like to see him.

497
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.357
- Yes, of course.
- Where is he?

498
00:32:14.359 --> 00:32:16.597
We'll take you inside. He's in bed.

499
00:32:16.599 --> 00:32:18.837
God Almighty!
Look at that herb garden.

500
00:32:18.839 --> 00:32:20.037
Does nobody tend it any more?

501
00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:22.517
Do people no longer
eat herbs any more?

502
00:32:22.519 --> 00:32:24.077
Do they only eat weeds?

503
00:32:24.079 --> 00:32:26.277
- Come on, we'll take you to see him.
- Where is Vasily?

504
00:32:26.279 --> 00:32:28.277
- I will get your brother here.
- Most helpful.

505
00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:30.238
- All right.
- She wants Vasily.

506
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.837
If Vasily is coming, granted,
we should probably have tea and buns.

507
00:32:33.839 --> 00:32:36.119
- We'll get some buns and some tea.
- Soak up the vodka.

508
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.478
What?

509
00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.077
I saw you and Big Boy
out in the woods earlier.

510
00:32:43.079 --> 00:32:45.079
- Yeah.
- There's bears in there.

511
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.198
You'd better watch your step, son.

512
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.559
- Well, there's bears in here too.
- Hm?

513
00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.878
Come on, play! Play better!

514
00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.277
Urgh!

515
00:32:58.279 --> 00:32:59.839
Oh, Jesus.

516
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.837
When we play Hungary,
are we allowed to use guns?

517
00:33:02.839 --> 00:33:05.198
These are the best
I could find since the plane crash.

518
00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.438
What plane crash?
There was never a plane crash.

519
00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.037
Was there a plane crash?
Soviet planes do not crash.

520
00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:12.440
And Stalin's son
does not fuck up.

521
00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.878
Christ!

522
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.478
We have Bobrov.
He wasn't on the plane.

523
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.519
What plane?

524
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.079
Bobrov!

525
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.000
- Go on. Hit it.
- No!

526
00:33:23.599 --> 00:33:26.517
He's terrified, practically leaving
a trail of yellow ice!

527
00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:29.357
You're the coach. Coach them so
they're as good as the dead team was.

528
00:33:29.359 --> 00:33:32.317
- Or I'll have you killed, okay?
- Apologies. And agreed.

529
00:33:32.319 --> 00:33:34.119
Or I'll just do it myself.

530
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.320
Come on! Play on!

531
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.198
Play through! Ignore me!

532
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.600
Get it. Give it. Hit it.

533
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.238
Vasily.

534
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.678
Play better, you clattering fannies!

535
00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.998
Come.

536
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.878
Oh, fuck!
Do they know about the crash?

537
00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.517
Give me a drink. I've got time
for a drink. Give me the flask.

538
00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:54.559
No, no.

539
00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.837
You are to come
to your father's dacha.

540
00:33:58.839 --> 00:34:00.277
The plane should never have taken off.

541
00:34:00.279 --> 00:34:02.357
Do you suppose
that just because I am who I am

542
00:34:02.359 --> 00:34:03.998
that I can predict an ice storm?

543
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.837
Ice storm? Are you saying something's
happened to our national team?

544
00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:09.077
- Nothing's happened.
- What the fuck are you doing?

545
00:34:09.079 --> 00:34:11.517
My father will have you saddled
and ridden to Siberia,

546
00:34:11.519 --> 00:34:13.079
you rude fucking pies.

547
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.398
These are good doctors,
my dear. They're the best.

548
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.200
They look like mental patients.

549
00:34:20.039 --> 00:34:22.279
Are they going to sing for us?
Why are they standing in a line?

550
00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.400
Let's have it.

551
00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:35.998
Following a group assessment
of Comrade Stalin,

552
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.517
we've arrived
at the unanimous conclusion,

553
00:34:39.519 --> 00:34:41.237
based on a collective finding...

554
00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:42.679
Please put him out of his misery.

555
00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:46.597
Comrade Stalin has had
a cerebral haemorrhage.

556
00:34:46.599 --> 00:34:48.677
The right side of his body
is paralysed.

557
00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:49.759
Oh, God.

558
00:34:51.559 --> 00:34:53.318
What is the chance of recovery?

559
00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.720
It is hard to say.

560
00:34:57.239 --> 00:35:01.719
Relax. I'm not gonna kiss you.
Will he recover, yes or no?

561
00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.358
No.

562
00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.720
- No?
- No.

563
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.000
It's over.

564
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.398
It's over!

565
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.838
I want a second opinion.
I don't trust these creatures to...

566
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.597
- I mean, how old are you?
- I'm 29.

567
00:35:20.599 --> 00:35:22.438
That's a lie. How old are you?

568
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.599
You look dead.

569
00:35:24.559 --> 00:35:27.077
I know people in Stalingrad.
I know people in Moscow.

570
00:35:27.079 --> 00:35:31.517
No, no, no. We have all the doctors.
There is no other opinion.

571
00:35:31.519 --> 00:35:33.878
- Oh, God.
- And so it begins.

572
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.998
Oh, God!

573
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.717
I cry for Stalin.
I cry for all the people.

574
00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:40.000
- I cry for the...
- Courage.

575
00:35:41.039 --> 00:35:43.838
Courage, little bird.
We're here for you.

576
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.278
Most of all, we cry for you,

577
00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.758
little... bird.

578
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.320
We offer our tears,
though not as a gift, of course.

579
00:35:56.679 --> 00:35:58.559
Oh, God.

580
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.798
I want Moscow cauterised, now.

581
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.998
Cut off the city.

582
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.318
- Moscow's closed. No-one gets in.
- Especially you.

583
00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.039
NKVD to displace army officers
at every station.

584
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.760
Army back to barracks.
We're taking over.

585
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.440
Remove Molotov from that last list.

586
00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.480
Implement our lists.

587
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.480
New lists.

588
00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.438
New lists.

589
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.079
Ladies and gentlemen,
reset your watches.

590
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.237
- New lists.
- New lists.

591
00:36:42.239 --> 00:36:43.597
- New lists.
- New lists.

592
00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:45.239
New lists.

593
00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.918
Trophy hunting, comrade?

594
00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.318
Oh, Svetlana. No, no. I was...

595
00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.557
We were just about to make a toast
to your father's health

596
00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:11.077
and I know he kept
some fine vodka here somewhere.

597
00:37:11.079 --> 00:37:13.597
Well, better you find it
than my brother.

598
00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:15.519
Ah, yes. Vasily.

599
00:37:16.239 --> 00:37:18.159
I got a hold of him
and he's on his way.

600
00:37:19.239 --> 00:37:21.037
- Oh...
- Svetlana, I wanted to...

601
00:37:21.039 --> 00:37:24.920
There was one day when my brother
just rode a pig through here.

602
00:37:25.639 --> 00:37:28.597
- That must have been messy.
- It was terribly messy.

603
00:37:28.599 --> 00:37:30.998
And my father was so cross.

604
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.398
Papa just chased him
around the room in a circle.

605
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.717
Right here around this sofa,
just there, look.

606
00:37:35.719 --> 00:37:40.318
Yes, I wanted to let you know
that no matter what happens,

607
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:45.157
I will never ever let any harm
come to you or your brother.

608
00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:48.117
- Who said anything about harm?
- No, that's what I'm saying.

609
00:37:48.119 --> 00:37:49.838
You know somebody
wants to harm us?

610
00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.637
- Tell me. I demand to know.
- If someone...

611
00:37:51.639 --> 00:37:53.557
No. I should not have used
the word "harm".

612
00:37:53.559 --> 00:37:55.440
Yes. But you keep mentioning
the word "harm". Why?

613
00:37:56.199 --> 00:38:02.199
If anyone tries to... you,
they'll have to get through me first.

614
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.037
My father's going to die.

615
00:38:09.039 --> 00:38:11.000
I'm going to have you
to look after me.

616
00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.080
I mean, I may as well
just shoot myself like Mother.

617
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.480
- Svetlana, we need to be strong.
- Who would put a lamp on a chair?

618
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.478
We need to be strong
and never afraid.

619
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:30.037
- I wasn't afraid. Now I am afraid.
- Don't be, because if any harm...

620
00:38:30.039 --> 00:38:31.278
God, I actually...

621
00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.517
can't believe you said that again.

622
00:38:32.519 --> 00:38:34.278
Quick! The boss is back!

623
00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.680
- Ohh!
- Come on!

624
00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.998
- Papa!
- A miracle.

625
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.398
Stalin is invincible.

626
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.077
The boss has shipped death
back to the salt mine.

627
00:38:45.079 --> 00:38:47.319
What's happening?
This is impossible...

628
00:38:49.079 --> 00:38:51.480
and... and... and wonderful.

629
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.358
- He's pointing...
- What is it, Chief?

630
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.237
Maybe he's appointing his successor.

631
00:38:58.239 --> 00:38:59.279
Do you think?

632
00:39:01.159 --> 00:39:02.478
- No.
- Maybe not.

633
00:39:03.639 --> 00:39:05.037
- What's he...
- It's the painting.

634
00:39:05.039 --> 00:39:07.878
- He's pointing at the painting.
- Hold on. You know what he's saying?

635
00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.000
He is saying, "I am the lamb."

636
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.517
Huh?

637
00:39:11.519 --> 00:39:15.557
"I am the lamb and you, you,
my children, have given me life."

638
00:39:15.559 --> 00:39:16.599
Yes!

639
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:22.758
Or the lamb is the people
and the milk is socialism.

640
00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.880
Maybe he's the milk.

641
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.918
Maybe you're the tit.

642
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.240
- Maybe he just wants a drink.
- A drink of milk.

643
00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.037
- Possible.
- Milk here! Immediately!

644
00:39:32.039 --> 00:39:35.717
- Not milk. Water. Water.
- And not in a horn. In a glass.

645
00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.758
So, Top Boy.

646
00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.280
You had your hair
fucking embalmed or something?

647
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.720
I owe it to him and the people.

648
00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.000
- There's going to be photos.
- Oh, right.

649
00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.998
You're a hero, Comrade Lukomsky.

650
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.880
This sometimes happens and I...

651
00:39:55.719 --> 00:39:58.159
I'm incredibly pleased.

652
00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.040
I won't forget it.

653
00:40:13.559 --> 00:40:14.559
Comrade.

654
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.640
We've remained at our post
as you ordered.

655
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.037
Might we respectfully
stand down from our position?

656
00:40:22.039 --> 00:40:23.079
Beria...

657
00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.559
...he's dead.

658
00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.717
- Oh, Jesus!
- Fuck my boots!

659
00:40:51.719 --> 00:40:53.517
Oh, my God.

660
00:40:53.519 --> 00:40:55.998
I'm sorry, boss.
I wish I could take it for you.

661
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.798
Thick skull, you know. It's
an incredibly strong, hard skull.

662
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.077
Shut up.

663
00:41:01.079 --> 00:41:02.758
We need to think about the Presidium.

664
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.240
Yes, succession. We need to...

665
00:41:06.159 --> 00:41:08.879
Oh, fuck. That's his...

666
00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.758
Who organised the Wurlitzer?

667
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.677
- It's a respirator.
- Did you use it?

668
00:41:15.679 --> 00:41:18.557
- No. It's American.
- It's what?

669
00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:20.637
- It's from his hospital.
- It was his idea.

670
00:41:20.639 --> 00:41:23.918
Let's just pretend these last
six sentences never happened.

671
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.838
Because if they ever find out
that we brought in...

672
00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.758
What are you doing to my father,
you jackals? Murderers!

673
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.197
- You'll kill him!
- Vasily, your father is dead.

674
00:41:31.199 --> 00:41:34.398
You're dividing the spoils.
Leave his brain alone!

675
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.918
- How old are you?
- I'm old.

676
00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.237
You're not old!
You're not even a person!

677
00:41:38.239 --> 00:41:41.237
You're a testicle!
You're made mostly of hair!

678
00:41:41.239 --> 00:41:43.117
- Vasily...
- Here's your fucking harvest.

679
00:41:43.119 --> 00:41:44.677
Here it is.

680
00:41:44.679 --> 00:41:46.799
Leave the man alone! I will not...

681
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.918
No! Don't let him shoot!

682
00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.237
- Just get the gun off him.
- Vasily!

683
00:41:52.239 --> 00:41:54.677
- Let her through.
- Remember what Papa said.

684
00:41:54.679 --> 00:41:56.998
They have a machine
filling his brain with American lies.

685
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.517
"Wade gently through the river

686
00:41:58.519 --> 00:42:00.717
because there are snakes
and crocodiles."

687
00:42:00.719 --> 00:42:03.597
It's okay, Vasily.
Everything's gonna be fine.

688
00:42:03.599 --> 00:42:06.597
- This is not exactly fine, is it?
- No, well, not exactly fine.

689
00:42:06.599 --> 00:42:08.157
My father's lying there
with his head open.

690
00:42:08.159 --> 00:42:10.998
Yes, your father is dead.
Your brother is shooting a gun.

691
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.358
It's not fine. You're right.

692
00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.559
Come on. There we go.

693
00:42:14.719 --> 00:42:17.719
You have all made
a deadly mistake.

694
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.920
- Excuse me.
- That's right. Off you go, kitten.

695
00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.519
Oh, come on.

696
00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.597
- Just keep the gun away from him.
- I've got loads, anyway.

697
00:42:54.599 --> 00:42:56.197
Have you forgotten
how to salute?

698
00:42:56.199 --> 00:42:58.359
- No, sir.
- Then salute me.

699
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.280
Now, let that be a warning.

700
00:43:03.079 --> 00:43:06.117
"Be strong," I hear my father say.

701
00:43:06.119 --> 00:43:07.237
Come on, chop, chop.

702
00:43:07.239 --> 00:43:08.439
Beria's picked you out.

703
00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.117
Just do as he says.

704
00:43:11.119 --> 00:43:15.197
- My car is right this way.
- No, no. She'll be happier with us.

705
00:43:15.199 --> 00:43:17.199
Okay, but we need to go. Let's go.

706
00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.119
- See you in Moscow.
- See you.

707
00:43:23.239 --> 00:43:24.559
Ah, nice.

708
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.080
We need to go through first!
No, let us go first!

709
00:43:51.519 --> 00:43:52.559
Go, go, go!

710
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.039
Go!

711
00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.278
Shit.
What, are we last now? Come on.

712
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.358
Comrades, we share your grief.

713
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.278
You will assemble outside
for further instructions.

714
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.318
All staff into the transport.
Yes, that's it, hurry up.

715
00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.677
Come on, get a move on.
In the transports, please.

716
00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:42.077
Where the fuck
did she come from? Get her out!

717
00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:43.679
Gently with that, will you?
Hurry up.

718
00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.280
That's it, everything out.

719
00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.798
Lookalikes.
I think their contract's up.

720
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:56.800
This way.

721
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.840
- You, come with me.
- But I don't understand.

722
00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.278
Come on. Just this way.

723
00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.280
You can stand down.

724
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.800
Food in the kitchen.

725
00:45:16.639 --> 00:45:18.037
Halt!

726
00:45:18.039 --> 00:45:19.639
Move them out!

727
00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:26.880
Last one! Move it out!

728
00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.559
Hello again.

729
00:45:47.039 --> 00:45:48.039
There you are.

730
00:45:50.679 --> 00:45:51.839
You're very quiet.

731
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.679
See the little birch in the meadow.

732
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:03.119
See the leaves dancing
when the wind blows.

733
00:46:05.039 --> 00:46:06.079
No?

734
00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.720
Well, come on, your voice was once
so beautiful, Polina Molotova.

735
00:46:13.079 --> 00:46:15.279
Oh, yes, sorry, meant to say.

736
00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.679
Stalin's dead.

737
00:46:19.159 --> 00:46:22.239
No. The Stalin?

738
00:46:23.559 --> 00:46:25.199
Our Stalin?

739
00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.800
Yeah, your Stalin.

740
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.639
The one who put you here.

741
00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.280
Come on.

742
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.117
Let's smarten you up
for Comrade Molotov.

743
00:46:39.119 --> 00:46:42.000
Good girl. Come on.

744
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:47.240
Oh, sorry, darling. Work.
I'll make it up to you.

745
00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:50.318
Fetch the mattress
and have her washed.

746
00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.320
Okay.

747
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.440
Right, get in there. Go on.

748
00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.998
Right, with me. Come on.

749
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.480
All right, jug, rug, flowers.
Right, grab that.

750
00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.557
- S-Slimonov, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

751
00:47:03.559 --> 00:47:05.679
See you l-later, S-Slimonov.

752
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.480
Come on.

753
00:47:11.159 --> 00:47:14.159
Bought you a lovely new dress,
a nice dress.

754
00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:39.557
Oh, God.

755
00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:46.278
Christ. You look like you're about
to be bulldozed into a lime pit.

756
00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.480
Need your toilet.

757
00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.237
Do you want me to hold back your hair?

758
00:47:54.239 --> 00:47:56.119
Polina always used to do that for me.

759
00:47:56.559 --> 00:47:57.880
Oh, no. Nothing's coming up.

760
00:47:58.679 --> 00:48:00.758
Futile gesture.

761
00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:05.918
Listen, I wanted to invite you
to tomorrow's Committee meeting.

762
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.920
Meeting?

763
00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.680
What meeting?
Why didn't I know about a meeting?

764
00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.560
Stalin and Beria put you on a list.

765
00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.000
Stalin?

766
00:48:26.199 --> 00:48:29.758
Oh, I must have wronged him so badly.
What did I do?

767
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.760
No, nothing. Don't you see?
Beria, he wants you out.

768
00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.278
Now, I've been talking
with Comrade Bulganin.

769
00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.358
No. No.

770
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.878
I think he's right.
We can outvote them.

771
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.438
No, no. This is factionalism.
Stalin didn't like factionalism.

772
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.079
Oh, Stalin is dead!

773
00:48:44.079 --> 00:48:48.037
I've seen inside of him.
For fuck's sake, we have to act.

774
00:48:48.039 --> 00:48:50.239
I can't believe he's gone.

775
00:48:51.679 --> 00:48:53.478
Ohh...

776
00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.840
You have to wait for it to fill up.

777
00:49:03.159 --> 00:49:05.159
Fucking apartments.

778
00:49:06.679 --> 00:49:07.759
Listen to me.

779
00:49:08.519 --> 00:49:10.840
Beria had Polina killed.

780
00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.278
Now, surely you must have wanted to...

781
00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.077
Act against the party? Me?

782
00:49:17.079 --> 00:49:18.637
- No?
- No, never.

783
00:49:18.639 --> 00:49:19.838
- Really?
- No.

784
00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.677
- Not once?
- Not once.

785
00:49:21.679 --> 00:49:24.557
Hello? Anyone home?

786
00:49:24.559 --> 00:49:26.880
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

787
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.438
We were just chatting.

788
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.200
About Polina.

789
00:49:32.119 --> 00:49:35.239
- Well, well, would you believe it?
- Treacherous sow.

790
00:49:36.519 --> 00:49:39.517
Or a wronged woman who was framed.

791
00:49:39.519 --> 00:49:41.159
No, no. She was a criminal.

792
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.800
I'm glad she's dead.

793
00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:46.438
Right, because,
well, she betrayed the party.

794
00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.157
- She plotted against Stalin.
- No, Nicky. False narrative.

795
00:49:49.159 --> 00:49:51.878
- No, no, she was a parasite.
- She was a parasite.

796
00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:56.597
She betrayed all of us, and, in fact,
the evidence was flimsy.

797
00:49:56.599 --> 00:49:59.637
There were no witnesses.
And look. Polina's back.

798
00:49:59.639 --> 00:50:01.440
Is it really you?

799
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:06.117
Oh, my Polina.
Oh, I can't believe it.

800
00:50:06.119 --> 00:50:07.998
Oh, look, everyone, look.

801
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.517
- My little Polinka's back.
- I am back.

802
00:50:11.519 --> 00:50:14.637
I kept her safe for you, Vyacheslav.

803
00:50:14.639 --> 00:50:17.037
And I kept him safe for you, Polina.

804
00:50:17.039 --> 00:50:19.398
- I've got so much to tell you.
- Good.

805
00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.438
- I've bought a dog...
- Oh?

806
00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.280
So many changes to come.

807
00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.680
And you're gonna like
some of them, Nicky.

808
00:50:30.199 --> 00:50:31.639
It's great to have you back.

809
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.120
Hello, my sweet.

810
00:50:54.239 --> 00:50:55.359
You're the parents?

811
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.480
Thank you. You should go now.

812
00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.720
We ready?

813
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.000
Good.

814
00:51:11.519 --> 00:51:13.639
Now, please don't go
until I say, okay?

815
00:51:15.719 --> 00:51:16.759
Did you hear me?

816
00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.597
Okay.

817
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.800
Yes? It's good?

818
00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.840
I'd like to try one
with a faraway look.

819
00:51:34.079 --> 00:51:35.197
Comrade,

820
00:51:35.199 --> 00:51:38.637
I've scheduled some telephone calls
later with various members of the...

821
00:51:38.639 --> 00:51:40.517
I can't hear you.
Can you say that again?

822
00:51:40.519 --> 00:51:43.758
I'm sorry. I've scheduled
some telephone calls later with...

823
00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.037
- Then tell me later.
- Of course.

824
00:51:46.039 --> 00:51:48.880
Mr Karloff, what an honour.
Love your work.

825
00:51:49.519 --> 00:51:53.197
Thinking of doing anything in colour?

826
00:51:53.199 --> 00:51:55.117
I need to talk to you about something.

827
00:51:55.119 --> 00:51:56.559
Would you please excuse me?

828
00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.159
I'll be right back.

829
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.320
Don't you ever... ever...

830
00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.039
humiliate me again in front of...

831
00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.758
I am the General Secretary
of the Soviet Union.

832
00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.557
Apologies. A line has been crossed.

833
00:52:16.559 --> 00:52:19.237
It is my duty to look good
for the people.

834
00:52:19.239 --> 00:52:21.637
- Of course.
- Ah, comrade, apologies.

835
00:52:21.639 --> 00:52:24.157
I'm not gonna do the seating plan.
Give it to Blavatsky.

836
00:52:24.159 --> 00:52:27.117
- He's expert at sitting on his arse.
- Of course. Thank you.

837
00:52:27.119 --> 00:52:28.878
- The Committee meeting...
- Oh, yes, yes.

838
00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:33.480
Um, item one:
these lists and these arrests.

839
00:52:34.159 --> 00:52:37.077
I think we...
Should we take that down just a gear?

840
00:52:37.079 --> 00:52:38.440
Or hold off altogether?

841
00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.677
- Freeze them?
- Freeze, yes.

842
00:52:42.679 --> 00:52:44.878
Excellent thought.
Yes, we could freeze arrests.

843
00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.157
We could even release
some low-level prisoners.

844
00:52:47.159 --> 00:52:50.918
Fuck me. I mean... I mean, yes.

845
00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.717
But what would the old man...

846
00:52:52.719 --> 00:52:57.438
Oh, Stalin... Stalin destroyed
the status quo and he built a new one.

847
00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.157
The changes he made
were both radical and popular.

848
00:53:00.159 --> 00:53:02.318
- Liberalisation would be radical.
- Popular.

849
00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.117
- Radical.
- And popular.

850
00:53:04.119 --> 00:53:07.037
I will deal with whatever horseshit

851
00:53:07.039 --> 00:53:08.438
you have presently.

852
00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.920
- Actually, I'd like you to see this.
- Come on through.

853
00:53:11.639 --> 00:53:15.717
You remember that famous photo
of Stalin and the little girl?

854
00:53:15.719 --> 00:53:16.838
Yes.

855
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:20.478
Well, I was thinking
a photo of, you and the girl.

856
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:21.760
Continuity.

857
00:53:22.239 --> 00:53:25.517
And this way we're showing Stalin's
humanity moving forward, right?

858
00:53:25.519 --> 00:53:26.639
Yeah.

859
00:53:27.599 --> 00:53:29.998
I'm sorry about all that.
Find the girl.

860
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.719
- We should head to the Committee.
- We are.

861
00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.998
So I'll outline the releases
under Article 31.

862
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.679
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

863
00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:45.358
Please, understand that this
is not some cynical ploy.

864
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:48.438
I mean, these reforms
are correct reforms.

865
00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.480
Totally understood.

866
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.559
Are you wearing a corset?

867
00:53:57.079 --> 00:53:59.799
It's a girdle. I have a bad back.

868
00:54:01.159 --> 00:54:03.998
It's functional. It's not cosmetic.

869
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.119
You wear it well.

870
00:54:07.039 --> 00:54:09.758
Let's make this
a test of your discretion, shall we?

871
00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.360
Of course. Of course.

872
00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.438
- So, in accordance...
- I call this meeting to order.

873
00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.760
My apologies.

874
00:54:24.519 --> 00:54:28.637
So, in accordance with his will,
I propose Comrade Malenkov

875
00:54:28.639 --> 00:54:30.398
be named Chairman
of the Council of Ministers

876
00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.400
and General Secretary of the Party.

877
00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.237
And I propose Comrade Beria

878
00:54:35.239 --> 00:54:38.117
for First Vice-Chairman,
Council of Ministers.

879
00:54:38.119 --> 00:54:40.557
So, let's take a vote.
Those in favour?

880
00:54:40.559 --> 00:54:42.358
Those are two separate proposals.

881
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.197
I suggest we vote one at a time.
Those in favour?

882
00:54:45.199 --> 00:54:47.717
I'm unsure of what's being proposed.

883
00:54:47.719 --> 00:54:49.918
I just said what was being proposed.
I just said it.

884
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.878
And you're being obstructionist.

885
00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:54.557
Comrade Beria is busy
combining his role

886
00:54:54.559 --> 00:54:56.798
as Minister for both
Interior and Security.

887
00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.918
Wouldn't it be kinder if someone else

888
00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.677
carried the happy burden
of Vice-Chairman?

889
00:55:00.679 --> 00:55:02.478
I thank Comrade Khrushchev
for his concern,

890
00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:05.237
but I'm perfectly capable
of doing two things at once.

891
00:55:05.239 --> 00:55:08.597
- Well, it's three things.
- Should we bring in an abacus?

892
00:55:08.599 --> 00:55:12.398
All right, let's move to a vote
on both proposals.

893
00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.677
All right? First me as... you know,

894
00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:18.197
and Comrade Beria as Vice-Chairman.

895
00:55:18.199 --> 00:55:19.279
All those in favour?

896
00:55:23.039 --> 00:55:24.119
Carried...

897
00:55:25.519 --> 00:55:27.478
u... nanimously.

898
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.597
Right, next.

899
00:55:28.599 --> 00:55:31.157
We need someone
to take charge of the funeral.

900
00:55:31.159 --> 00:55:33.717
- What about Comrade Khrushchev?
- Where's this coming from?

901
00:55:33.719 --> 00:55:35.557
I formally propose Comrade Khrushchev

902
00:55:35.559 --> 00:55:37.438
be given the honour
of organising the funeral.

903
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.237
What? Come on,
I don't have any time to do that.

904
00:55:39.239 --> 00:55:41.438
What if I can do three things at once,
you can at least do two.

905
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.478
What do I know about funerals?

906
00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:45.438
You said you wanted
to honour his legacy.

907
00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:47.480
You told me last night
in the bathroom.

908
00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:54.037
- All those in... all those in favour?
- All those in favour?

909
00:55:54.039 --> 00:55:55.517
No, uh...

910
00:55:55.519 --> 00:55:58.519
Well, I think you'd be good,
actually, you know.

911
00:56:01.119 --> 00:56:02.758
Passed unanimously.

912
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.237
Nicky Khrushchev, funeral director.
It suits you.

913
00:56:05.239 --> 00:56:06.998
- Yeah.
- It suits that face, anyway.

914
00:56:09.239 --> 00:56:12.557
- Comrade Beria.
- I propose a halt to deportations,

915
00:56:12.559 --> 00:56:16.838
the release of some existing detainees
under Article 31 and the suspension

916
00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.597
of all arrests that were officially
sanctioned three days ago.

917
00:56:19.599 --> 00:56:24.077
Whoa, whoa. That's like wiping
your arse on Stalin's final list.

918
00:56:24.079 --> 00:56:25.878
- No, no, no.
- This is demonstrably revisionist.

919
00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:30.119
Releasing people we arrested three
days ago will make us look cretinous.

920
00:56:30.679 --> 00:56:32.758
Listen, Stalin was misled.

921
00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.717
- We were misled.
- Really?

922
00:56:34.719 --> 00:56:38.197
Yes. So the people responsible
should be found and punished.

923
00:56:38.199 --> 00:56:41.117
Who are you kidding,
Lavrenti, yourself?

924
00:56:41.119 --> 00:56:44.597
We all knew what we were doing
when we signed those lists.

925
00:56:44.599 --> 00:56:50.039
Stalin destroyed the status quo...
and he rebuilt it.

926
00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.717
He was liberal.

927
00:56:52.719 --> 00:56:54.237
- Radical.
- He was radical.

928
00:56:54.239 --> 00:56:56.318
This is a blatant attempt
by Comrade Beria

929
00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:57.838
to buy the support of the public.

930
00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:00.838
I thought you were in favour of a more
liberal approach, Comrade Reformer.

931
00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:04.077
All those in favour
of pausing the arrests,

932
00:57:04.079 --> 00:57:06.639
of pausing the executions?

933
00:57:08.079 --> 00:57:09.159
All those in favour?

934
00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:17.079
Hmm. I've always been loyal to Stalin.
Always.

935
00:57:17.639 --> 00:57:20.438
And these arrests
were authorised by Stalin.

936
00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:23.157
But Stalin was also loyal
to the collective leadership,

937
00:57:23.159 --> 00:57:25.519
and that is true loyalty.

938
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:31.398
However, he also had an iron will,
undeviating, strong.

939
00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.240
Should we not do the same
and stick to what we believed in?

940
00:57:36.079 --> 00:57:37.079
No.

941
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.878
It is stronger still
to forge our own beliefs

942
00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:43.840
with the beliefs
of the collective leadership.

943
00:57:44.679 --> 00:57:47.519
Which I have now... done.

944
00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.717
Carried... unanimously. Thank you.

945
00:57:54.719 --> 00:57:56.319
I'll oversee the releases.

946
00:57:57.559 --> 00:58:00.039
We have loosened
the Union's great corset.

947
00:58:01.599 --> 00:58:04.998
Nicky, you've some bouquets
and swatches to look at.

948
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.679
A funeral doesn't organise itself.

949
00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.358
- Long live Stalin.
- Stalin's dead. Malenkov's in charge.

950
00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:18.798
- Stop shooting.
- Long live Malenk...

951
00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.717
Amnesty effective immediately.

952
00:58:20.719 --> 00:58:23.879
Orders of Comrade Beria.
We're moving out. Let's go.

953
00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:26.120
Come on, let's go.

954
00:58:41.159 --> 00:58:42.399
Come on.

955
00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:47.758
Ahh...

956
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.880
Oh, my God!

957
00:58:50.559 --> 00:58:52.799
Ohh!

958
00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:28.517
Not too much on that.
He's not Clark Gable, okay?

959
00:59:28.519 --> 00:59:30.478
Can somebody get a duster up there?

960
00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:32.798
We've got a cobweb
large enough to snag a sheep.

961
00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.717
We're opening in 15 minutes.

962
00:59:34.719 --> 00:59:36.278
Now, for the curtains
at the front, comrade,

963
00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.077
do you want ruched, not ruched?

964
00:59:38.079 --> 00:59:40.237
- Whatever. I don't care.
- Not ruched?

965
00:59:40.239 --> 00:59:42.719
- That's good. That's...
- Ruched? Not ruched?

966
00:59:43.239 --> 00:59:45.239
- Ruched?
- Would you stop with this?

967
00:59:45.679 --> 00:59:47.879
Why do you think I care?
Ah, excuse me.

968
00:59:49.519 --> 00:59:51.717
- Fix that button.
- Welcome, comrades.

969
00:59:51.719 --> 00:59:53.998
How's the Minister
for Fixtures and Fittings?

970
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.278
It's going well. I'm enjoying it.

971
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.517
- Yes, you're very passionate.
- Well...

972
00:59:57.519 --> 00:59:59.318
Yes, the ruched, please. Thank you.

973
00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.358
- You're doing a great job.
- I know.

974
01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.237
Well, hello. Are these...

975
01:00:03.239 --> 01:00:05.037
- Oh.
- These my...

976
01:00:05.039 --> 01:00:06.318
Which one of these is my girl?

977
01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.918
We couldn't find the actual girl, sir.

978
01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.717
These are some possible alternatives.

979
01:00:09.719 --> 01:00:12.037
No, no, I want you to find...
Excuse me.

980
01:00:12.039 --> 01:00:13.998
I want you to find
the girl in the photograph.

981
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.920
Do you understand?
The nation depends on it.

982
01:00:17.119 --> 01:00:18.679
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

983
01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:22.720
All right, girls, the Snow King
does not approve. Wait over there.

984
01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.677
What happened?
Where's the girl in the photograph?

985
01:00:25.679 --> 01:00:27.398
We couldn't find the actual girl.

986
01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.077
I thought the entire point of the NKVD
was to know everyone's whereabouts.

987
01:00:31.079 --> 01:00:32.758
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir, yes.

988
01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.320
- So, you find her, you camel cock.
- Comrade Khrushchev.

989
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.677
- Maria Veniaminovna.
- Yes.

990
01:00:37.679 --> 01:00:40.237
I'm sorry that you heard that,
but he is a camel cock.

991
01:00:40.239 --> 01:00:42.159
- How are you, Maria?
- Stalin?

992
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.360
Yes. You want to have a look?

993
01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:52.079
Comrade Beria, this is Maria.
She'll be playing piano tonight.

994
01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.637
- Good to meet you.
- Comrade.

995
01:00:54.639 --> 01:00:55.799
What do you think?

996
01:00:57.119 --> 01:01:00.440
Small. He looks so small.

997
01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.637
- Sad day, soldier.
- Yes, sir.

998
01:01:06.639 --> 01:01:07.998
Sad day.

999
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.400
Aslanov. You handsome devil.

1000
01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.398
Stick you in a frock,
I'd fucking ride you raw myself.

1001
01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.758
- I will take that as a compliment.
- Yeah, don't.

1002
01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.280
Right, what's a war hero got to do
to get some lubrication round here?

1003
01:01:30.519 --> 01:01:32.117
Ah, Generalissimo.

1004
01:01:32.119 --> 01:01:34.039
There he is, eh, the great man.

1005
01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.117
I've seen a lot of death,
but that... that is a loss.

1006
01:01:39.119 --> 01:01:40.677
Tell me something.

1007
01:01:40.679 --> 01:01:44.998
Why has the army been replaced
by the NKVD all over Moscow?

1008
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.677
I mean, I'm smiling,
but I am very fucking furious.

1009
01:01:48.679 --> 01:01:50.478
Perhaps this is a good time
for Comrade Yudina

1010
01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.438
to go and prepare
those precious fingers.

1011
01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.077
Yes. One moment, General.

1012
01:01:54.079 --> 01:01:56.478
I will properly catch up with you
this evening.

1013
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.838
- I'm looking forward to it.
- You never kiss my hand any more.

1014
01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.597
- I taught Nikita's niece to play.
- Yes, you did.

1015
01:02:02.599 --> 01:02:04.358
That was quite the salon recital.

1016
01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.240
Oh, I love the idea of you at a salon.

1017
01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.117
Do you have a party trick?
Burping the alphabet?

1018
01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.717
Comrade Malenkov, with sharper
cheekbones, as requested.

1019
01:02:13.719 --> 01:02:16.439
Sharp. Not sharp.
Sharp. Not sharp.

1020
01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.680
I would like...

1021
01:02:20.599 --> 01:02:23.358
...that one destroyed, thank you.

1022
01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.318
Good luck with the performance
tonight, by the way.

1023
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.197
- Thank you.
- Nerve-racking, so many notes.

1024
01:02:28.199 --> 01:02:30.439
- Yes.
- Like your one to Stalin.

1025
01:02:32.079 --> 01:02:33.239
Which I have.

1026
01:02:36.239 --> 01:02:37.677
Come this way.

1027
01:02:37.679 --> 01:02:40.197
Why has the army
been confined to barracks?

1028
01:02:40.199 --> 01:02:43.157
The decision was mine,
supported by Comrade Malenkov.

1029
01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:44.597
Mm-hmm. Oh, was it indeed?

1030
01:02:44.599 --> 01:02:46.758
That right, Georgy?
It was your call?

1031
01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.358
Um, yes, of course.
We had to make a decision.

1032
01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.798
We're discussing the city's security.

1033
01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.637
- I know.
- Jesus Christ.

1034
01:02:53.639 --> 01:02:55.559
Did Coco Chanel
take a shit on your head?

1035
01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.517
- No, he did not.
- Listen, listen.

1036
01:02:59.519 --> 01:03:01.278
Moscow's gonna be boiling with people.

1037
01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.597
His little fucking apes at the NKVD
won't know what to do.

1038
01:03:04.599 --> 01:03:06.157
There's gonna be
thousands of civilians

1039
01:03:06.159 --> 01:03:07.998
flooding in from all over Russia.

1040
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.838
No, we're controlling
the crowd at source.

1041
01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.920
All trains and vans to Moscow
have been cancelled.

1042
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.278
- You can't do that.
- Wait a minute.

1043
01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.517
People have a right to see him.

1044
01:03:15.519 --> 01:03:17.557
- Oh, come on. No, no, no.
- Just temporarily.

1045
01:03:17.559 --> 01:03:21.117
I'm the funeral. I'm the trains.
This is horseshit, okay?

1046
01:03:21.119 --> 01:03:24.557
I've been picking out funeral cushions
with Slim Hitler over there...

1047
01:03:24.559 --> 01:03:27.758
calico this, taffeta that,
and you've done what?

1048
01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.197
No, I'm the trains and
I want them back.

1049
01:03:30.199 --> 01:03:33.438
Well, let's see who can
mobilise first. Oh, seems to be me!

1050
01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.200
You sneaky little shit.

1051
01:03:36.039 --> 01:03:38.239
And we're opening the doors.

1052
01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.677
Good. Steady pace.
Very good. Yes, just like that.

1053
01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.519
Rather overwhelming, isn't it?

1054
01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:10.037
And nobody's making them do this,
are they?

1055
01:04:10.039 --> 01:04:11.199
- No, no.
- No.

1056
01:04:12.199 --> 01:04:13.719
Just round to the right. Thank you.

1057
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.597
I don't suppose you want a chair?

1058
01:04:16.599 --> 01:04:20.677
Oh, no, no, no. I can't sit down.
I haven't sat down since he died.

1059
01:04:20.679 --> 01:04:22.239
One can't. He was too big.

1060
01:04:24.559 --> 01:04:25.639
Yes.

1061
01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.519
Do you remember Alexei?

1062
01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.077
- I remember everyone. It's a gift.
- Oh.

1063
01:04:35.079 --> 01:04:36.878
Do you remember
the way he used to laugh?

1064
01:04:39.639 --> 01:04:42.359
- Alexei Kapler, yes, yes.
- Yes.

1065
01:04:43.199 --> 01:04:45.878
Yes, special to you, of course.

1066
01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.720
Some unsuitable associates.

1067
01:04:49.239 --> 01:04:51.597
Tragic, really.

1068
01:04:51.599 --> 01:04:53.559
I'm... I'm so sorry.

1069
01:04:54.239 --> 01:04:56.639
Yes, well,
I want you to bring him back.

1070
01:04:59.199 --> 01:05:01.159
The way that you brought
Molotov's wife back.

1071
01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.000
She...

1072
01:05:05.159 --> 01:05:08.879
- Well, I'd kept her as...
- Yeah, but I just want one person.

1073
01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.160
Just one person.

1074
01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.680
- Oh, my darling.
- Please.

1075
01:05:15.199 --> 01:05:17.519
For you,
I will attempt the impossible.

1076
01:05:26.679 --> 01:05:29.519
Keep it moving if you can. Thank you.

1077
01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.559
A lot of people to process.

1078
01:05:40.559 --> 01:05:44.279
Oh, fucking pollen. They should make
gas bombs out of the stuff.

1079
01:05:46.679 --> 01:05:48.559
Wait, wait, wait.
That's not gonna fit.

1080
01:05:49.159 --> 01:05:52.358
- It's larger than the region itself.
- Go back. Go back.

1081
01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.920
Hunker down.

1082
01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.400
A quarter turn.

1083
01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:00.760
Through on that line.

1084
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:05.358
- How's Polina?
- She's well.

1085
01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.320
I can sense how sorry she is
for her treachery.

1086
01:06:11.639 --> 01:06:13.519
Jesus Christ, it's the bishops.

1087
01:06:15.199 --> 01:06:17.597
I thought we'd banned those freaks.

1088
01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:19.838
Sneeze on the bastards
as they go past.

1089
01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.758
- Did you invite them?
- No.

1090
01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.400
- Ask Beria if he invited the bishops.
- Don't give me orders.

1091
01:06:27.159 --> 01:06:29.677
Ask Beria if he invited the bishops.

1092
01:06:29.679 --> 01:06:32.679
- Did you invite the bishops?
- Yes.

1093
01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.838
- Yes.
- Well?

1094
01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.480
He said yes.

1095
01:06:37.239 --> 01:06:39.478
I'm going to give everyone
in Red Square a voucher

1096
01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:42.918
permitting one kick each
to his stupid face.

1097
01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:44.918
Is he asking for some delicious hay?

1098
01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.000
No, he said something quite
complicated about a voucher system.

1099
01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:53.677
Ask Nikita why in God's arse
he invited the bishops.

1100
01:06:53.679 --> 01:06:55.838
- No, I've already explained why...
- Ask Nikita.

1101
01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.039
You tell him...

1102
01:06:58.519 --> 01:07:00.798
- Never mind. Swap.
- No.

1103
01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.880
- Just swap with me.
- I said no.

1104
01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.320
We can make it look like
it's part of the ceremony.

1105
01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:20.839
What the fuck are you doing?

1106
01:07:27.519 --> 01:07:30.077
Buttoned-up sacks of shit! Fleabags!

1107
01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:31.679
Should I handle this for you?

1108
01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:37.517
Foreigners. A vile crime
has been perpetrated.

1109
01:07:37.519 --> 01:07:41.597
Hairy monsters in coats
have scooped out my father's brain

1110
01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:44.157
and sent it to America.

1111
01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:47.480
And these traitors,
sucking the cocks and balls...

1112
01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:50.478
...sucking the cocks and balls
of Zionist...

1113
01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.157
New York...
New York Zionist queers in petticoats.

1114
01:07:54.159 --> 01:07:56.878
Look at them. You see?
Those brain thieves.

1115
01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.717
- Do not translate this.
- I see you. Heed me.

1116
01:07:58.719 --> 01:08:01.398
- There's food next door, gentlemen.
- I'm Stalin's son!

1117
01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:04.758
You will not take me down.
I will not go down!

1118
01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.800
Please,
this side. I'm sorry. I apologise.

1119
01:08:07.639 --> 01:08:09.717
I will not be silen...

1120
01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:11.599
I know about the hockey team.

1121
01:08:12.519 --> 01:08:14.918
- I'm most deeply...
- Up we go. That's it.

1122
01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:16.838
Thank you all for your...

1123
01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.357
Medic!

1124
01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:19.718
Not today!

1125
01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:23.240
You're a fucking stain
on that uniform. You fucking behave.

1126
01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.397
What is going on?

1127
01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:27.437
He felt a little overwhelmed,
Svetlana.

1128
01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:30.718
Harm. This is a perfect
example of harm.

1129
01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.838
- He's okay.
- Come here. Get up.

1130
01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.518
- Who did this?
- I did, and I enjoyed it.

1131
01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.840
It's been a long time coming.

1132
01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.079
If any of you...

1133
01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.360
...should do anything...

1134
01:08:43.159 --> 01:08:45.037
Right, well, that's me told.

1135
01:08:45.039 --> 01:08:48.077
I'm off to represent
the entire Red Army at the buffet.

1136
01:08:48.079 --> 01:08:49.279
You girls enjoy yourself.

1137
01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:53.518
Are you all right? He fell very hard.

1138
01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.037
Why did you let him do that?

1139
01:08:55.039 --> 01:08:58.317
Yes, I should have intercepted
his fist with my face.

1140
01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:00.559
I want to make a speech
at my father's funeral.

1141
01:09:01.119 --> 01:09:04.237
- And I want to fuck Grace Kelly.
- I simply don't care.

1142
01:09:04.239 --> 01:09:06.477
I want to make a speech
at my father's funeral.

1143
01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:08.199
Comrade Malenkov, your view?

1144
01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:10.479
Well, I think, um...

1145
01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.878
it can be, um...

1146
01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:15.718
- no... no problem.
- Ah...

1147
01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.197
Technically, yes, but practically...

1148
01:09:18.199 --> 01:09:20.518
There are programmatic complications.

1149
01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.838
You know, I think I misspoke
when I said, "No problem."

1150
01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.119
What I meant was, "No."

1151
01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:26.840
"Problem."

1152
01:09:29.079 --> 01:09:31.918
Ignore me. I'm... It's no problem.

1153
01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.117
- Yes. I take that as a yes.
- Go ahead, Nikita.

1154
01:09:34.119 --> 01:09:36.918
I will unlock the schedule
and squeeze him in.

1155
01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.678
I will not be squeezed.

1156
01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.159
Sometimes the shortest speeches
are the most memorable.

1157
01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.838
- Well, that's as maybe.
- True. Fish! Let's eat.

1158
01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.638
- What's going on?
- I don't...

1159
01:09:47.199 --> 01:09:49.277
I look forward
to the five garbled words

1160
01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:51.437
we afford him
before we start the flypast.

1161
01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:54.237
Hey, we need to talk.
First the trains, now the bishops.

1162
01:09:54.239 --> 01:09:55.918
Who else are we pals with now?

1163
01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.357
- You invite any old Nazis?
- Excuse me.

1164
01:09:58.359 --> 01:10:01.077
These stairs are like climbing
Mount Kilimanjaro.

1165
01:10:01.079 --> 01:10:02.718
I'm more sweat than man.

1166
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.718
- Did you see off Vasily?
- Yes, we did.

1167
01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.838
And thank you
for landing me this funeral.

1168
01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.838
Come on, Nicky. You're enjoying it.

1169
01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.317
But why did you
have to invite the bishops?

1170
01:10:11.319 --> 01:10:13.918
What, you think I wanted
those boyfriends of Christ here?

1171
01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.157
That was his idea.

1172
01:10:15.159 --> 01:10:17.598
Lavrenti, you of all people must know

1173
01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.437
that religion
has never been part of...

1174
01:10:19.439 --> 01:10:22.237
You lecturing me?
You standing in the Hall of Columns

1175
01:10:22.239 --> 01:10:24.519
still insisting on Polina's guilt?

1176
01:10:25.359 --> 01:10:27.359
Well, she... she is...

1177
01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.437
- Um, sorry. Maybe I shouldn't have...
- Oh, come on.

1178
01:10:32.439 --> 01:10:35.638
No, no. You both called
the blameless Polina Molotova

1179
01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:38.558
a traitor and a parasite
in her own apartment. I heard you.

1180
01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:41.678
She was guilty.
You found her guilty.

1181
01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.077
And Stalin agreed.
Nobody doubted.

1182
01:10:44.079 --> 01:10:46.157
Nobody doubted.
Past tense, you see.

1183
01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:48.758
In the good old days you pine for,
that sort of dissonance

1184
01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.437
would have had you both shot.
Both of you.

1185
01:10:50.439 --> 01:10:53.197
Oh,
this is just fucking wordplay.

1186
01:10:53.199 --> 01:10:54.239
Oh, is it?

1187
01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:58.197
Allegiance to the party line, hm?
That was what Stalin demanded.

1188
01:10:58.199 --> 01:10:59.397
Correct, Comrade Molotov?

1189
01:10:59.399 --> 01:11:02.558
Um, allegiance to the party line? Yes.

1190
01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.558
And defiance of the party line,

1191
01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.560
that would mark you out
as a traitor, wouldn't it?

1192
01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.037
I'm ashamed and I... I...

1193
01:11:10.039 --> 01:11:13.598
I beg your forgiveness
for my selfish deceitfulness,

1194
01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.880
and I will go and reassure Polina.

1195
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.838
You're just making this shit up
as you go along.

1196
01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.798
- What game is this, Lavrenti?
- Oh, don't be hysterical.

1197
01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.998
- We're in a new reality.
- What, you're the good guy now?

1198
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.317
You locked up half the nation.

1199
01:11:31.319 --> 01:11:33.758
You beat them, you raped them,
you killed them.

1200
01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.397
Yes, and now I'm releasing them.

1201
01:11:35.399 --> 01:11:37.678
And you won't believe
how many will be free.

1202
01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.840
So now you want the public
to love you, is that it?

1203
01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.998
You're bending and cracking the truth
like a human body.

1204
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.157
The truth?

1205
01:11:44.159 --> 01:11:46.838
This from the man who invited
his bit-on-the-side whore pianist

1206
01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.317
to play at the funeral,
even though she swore to kill Stalin,

1207
01:11:49.319 --> 01:11:50.437
who's now dead.

1208
01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:53.077
Whoa. What the barrelling fuck
are you talking about?

1209
01:11:53.079 --> 01:11:55.397
She wanted Stalin dead
and she knows your family.

1210
01:11:55.399 --> 01:11:57.599
She taught your niece
to play, remember?

1211
01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.000
I think you should read this.

1212
01:12:01.399 --> 01:12:05.598
It's the copy of a note I found
by Stalin's body, from the pianist.

1213
01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.077
It's lucky we both now live
in the new Soviet Union

1214
01:12:08.079 --> 01:12:09.437
or you and your wife and your family

1215
01:12:09.439 --> 01:12:12.639
would be a pile of dust
on the floor of a crematorium toilet.

1216
01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.638
Kobulov! My stomach's rumbling.

1217
01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.280
Is there any cheese in this building?

1218
01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.437
No, I don't have time
for that shit right now.

1219
01:12:28.439 --> 01:12:30.000
Wait, wait, wait.
Come back, come back.

1220
01:12:31.079 --> 01:12:32.199
No, go.

1221
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:37.157
New security orders.
Restart the trains, all right?

1222
01:12:37.159 --> 01:12:40.119
Open the city's borders
and let the people back into Moscow.

1223
01:12:42.039 --> 01:12:43.718
They deserve to see the old man.

1224
01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.119
Let's see how Beria's goons
cope with that.

1225
01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.518
Train to Moscow in five minutes!

1226
01:13:32.439 --> 01:13:35.359
- What's going on?
- Trains are bringing them in.

1227
01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.720
Quiet. Quiet, quiet.

1228
01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.039
Turn around!

1229
01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:52.397
- This is a secure area!
- We've come to see Comrade Stalin!

1230
01:13:52.399 --> 01:13:55.157
Back. Get back. Back!

1231
01:13:55.159 --> 01:13:56.720
Back.

1232
01:13:57.399 --> 01:14:00.159
- Stay back.
- Stay where you are!

1233
01:14:02.239 --> 01:14:04.479
Fire over their heads.

1234
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.080
Don't let them through!

1235
01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.518
This is your work, is it?

1236
01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.120
Why? Are there spelling mistakes?

1237
01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.157
Do you have any idea
what kind of man Beria is?

1238
01:14:42.159 --> 01:14:44.598
He's releasing people from prison.

1239
01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.200
That was my idea.
I was going to do that.

1240
01:14:48.319 --> 01:14:51.117
I'm the reformer. Me.

1241
01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:55.758
Don't you fucking laugh at me.
I was going to release the bishops.

1242
01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.077
- I thought you hated the Church.
- I do!

1243
01:14:58.079 --> 01:15:00.880
Just tell me it's not true.
Did you write this?

1244
01:15:02.279 --> 01:15:04.758
Stalin killed my family, my friends.

1245
01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:08.357
- Zinaida Reich, Kuperchinski.
- Kup... You knew Kuperchinski?

1246
01:15:08.359 --> 01:15:10.357
I should have you shot
just for saying his name.

1247
01:15:10.359 --> 01:15:12.558
Comrade Nikita Sergeyevich,
you know me. I...

1248
01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:16.277
Stop. No, I... I don't know you.
You don't know me.

1249
01:15:16.279 --> 01:15:20.437
You fucking taught
my niece piano lessons. That's it.

1250
01:15:20.439 --> 01:15:24.077
Don't you see what Beria's done now?
He's tied me to you.

1251
01:15:24.079 --> 01:15:25.319
We are tied together.

1252
01:15:26.319 --> 01:15:27.798
- Like a rock...
- I know.

1253
01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.437
...that's sinking and...

1254
01:15:29.439 --> 01:15:31.759
But I'm confident of everlasting life.

1255
01:15:33.399 --> 01:15:36.237
Who the fuck in their right mind
would want everlasting life?

1256
01:15:36.239 --> 01:15:38.199
The endless conversation.

1257
01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:45.437
Piano lessons, Nicky?
How's the fingering?

1258
01:15:45.439 --> 01:15:47.758
She hit the high note, did she?

1259
01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.397
F sharp?

1260
01:15:49.399 --> 01:15:51.598
Yeah, two clowns,
one joke between you.

1261
01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.079
Work on your fucking material.

1262
01:15:55.079 --> 01:15:56.718
Something's happening over there.

1263
01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.397
I hate him.
Hate her. Fucking wet box.

1264
01:16:00.399 --> 01:16:03.437
- Can you please just be cordial?
- I know the drill.

1265
01:16:03.439 --> 01:16:05.998
Smile, shake hands
and try not to call them a cunt.

1266
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.399
Perfect. That's perfect.

1267
01:16:08.319 --> 01:16:10.998
- How many?
- 1500.

1268
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.359
- Dead?
- Yes.

1269
01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.798
- I need a man with an army.
- Comrade minister.

1270
01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:20.037
I found her. She's uh...
grown a little since the photograph.

1271
01:16:20.039 --> 01:16:22.237
She's the size of an ostrich. No.

1272
01:16:22.239 --> 01:16:24.157
Okay, can we just go back
to my original idea

1273
01:16:24.159 --> 01:16:26.798
and find a girl
who looks like her but little?

1274
01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.477
No higher than this.
Chalk it on your fucking trousers.

1275
01:16:29.479 --> 01:16:33.077
Modern soldier's greatest fear.
It's not death. It's not starvation.

1276
01:16:33.079 --> 01:16:34.237
It's chafing.

1277
01:16:34.239 --> 01:16:36.758
And then he planted the flag
on Hitler's bunker

1278
01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.077
or he knocked the bear out
with one punch.

1279
01:16:39.079 --> 01:16:42.157
Either way, the man's a war hero.
Excuse us, please.

1280
01:16:42.159 --> 01:16:44.558
Listen, it was Goebbels' bunker,
not Hitler's.

1281
01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.357
Listen to me. I was the one
who put the trains back on.

1282
01:16:47.359 --> 01:16:49.077
- Comrade General...
- Fuck off!

1283
01:16:49.079 --> 01:16:50.798
Or I'll punch you into a sticky pulp.

1284
01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.037
- Thank you.
- What the fuck were you thinking?

1285
01:16:53.039 --> 01:16:55.037
I don't know, okay, but I did it.

1286
01:16:55.039 --> 01:16:57.798
- And I really need your help.
- To do what?

1287
01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.477
There's bodies fucking
piling up in the street.

1288
01:16:59.479 --> 01:17:00.558
It's a bit late, isn't it.

1289
01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.037
What if we blame this on someone...

1290
01:17:03.039 --> 01:17:04.838
- Wait.
- ...who's out of control.

1291
01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:07.840
Nicky, be very careful
what you say next.

1292
01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.640
Who?

1293
01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.079
Beria.

1294
01:17:13.039 --> 01:17:15.477
I'm gonna have to report
this conversation.

1295
01:17:15.479 --> 01:17:17.037
Threatening to do harm

1296
01:17:17.039 --> 01:17:19.798
or obstruct any member
of the Presidium in the process of...

1297
01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.558
Look at your fucking face.

1298
01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:26.237
Nikita Khrushchev.

1299
01:17:26.239 --> 01:17:29.638
- You balls like Kremlin domes.
- Stop. Be serious. Are you in?

1300
01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:33.317
I'm in, I'm in. That fucker thinks
he can take on the Red Army.

1301
01:17:33.319 --> 01:17:37.037
I fucked Germany. I think I can take
a flesh lump in a fucking waistcoat.

1302
01:17:37.039 --> 01:17:39.758
- It's got to be tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

1303
01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.838
Sorry.
You busy washing your hair or what?

1304
01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.277
Tomorrow's the funeral.

1305
01:17:43.279 --> 01:17:46.279
Yeah, the day that the entire fucking
army's in town with their guns.

1306
01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.998
That's perfect.

1307
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.798
But we need the Presidium on board.
Every one of them.

1308
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.518
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Malenkov's a bit tricky.

1309
01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:57.878
- No. We need fucking all of them.
- Well, I'll get him.

1310
01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.317
- How many?
- 1500.

1311
01:18:05.319 --> 01:18:08.558
Find Khrushchev. I want to talk
to him about his future.

1312
01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.120
A very short conversation.

1313
01:18:11.439 --> 01:18:14.197
If you could do me a favour
and just nod as I'm speaking.

1314
01:18:14.199 --> 01:18:16.117
People are looking to me
for reassurance

1315
01:18:16.119 --> 01:18:17.718
and I have no idea what is going on.

1316
01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:20.678
We will bring the situation
under control. Order will be restored.

1317
01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:23.758
This moron has restarted the trains.

1318
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.037
And your men pissed their pants
and killed 1500 people.

1319
01:18:27.039 --> 01:18:28.437
We were controlling the crowd.

1320
01:18:28.439 --> 01:18:30.077
Those people weren't
supposed to be there.

1321
01:18:30.079 --> 01:18:31.237
Are you blaming the dead

1322
01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:32.437
for their own death?

1323
01:18:32.439 --> 01:18:35.638
I'm gonna tell you who's going to be
blamed. I am going to be blamed.

1324
01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.720
This shit sack is going to be blamed.

1325
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.199
Let's get out of here.

1326
01:18:43.279 --> 01:18:46.518
- Comrade, your girl. A girl.
- Ah! There you are.

1327
01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.718
Are we ready for the balcony wave?

1328
01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.437
Who's gonna carry the can
for this farrago of shit?

1329
01:18:52.439 --> 01:18:54.638
That's easy. Khrushchev.
He put the trains back on.

1330
01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.598
And you shot the people
getting off them.

1331
01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.277
- Yes, he has a point.
- No, he doesn't.

1332
01:18:58.279 --> 01:19:00.037
There's no point
to Nikita Khrushchev.

1333
01:19:00.039 --> 01:19:03.077
Well, how about this?
We blame the security forces.

1334
01:19:03.079 --> 01:19:05.197
Right? Hothead officers
on the ground.

1335
01:19:05.199 --> 01:19:07.077
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1336
01:19:07.079 --> 01:19:09.397
Do you still possess a working brain?

1337
01:19:09.399 --> 01:19:12.437
You dumb animal.
I am the security forces

1338
01:19:12.439 --> 01:19:15.518
and I'm not gonna be made the villain
for this catastrophe.

1339
01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:18.878
Look, even if you do get blamed,
we close ranks.

1340
01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.437
If anyone has a pop at you,
they have to come through us first.

1341
01:19:21.439 --> 01:19:24.197
Yes, good idea.
Give me the girl. All right?

1342
01:19:24.199 --> 01:19:26.878
- A lot of this is your own doing.
- You spineless rat.

1343
01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.558
You're just a cadaver
we propped up in a corset.

1344
01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.397
- Ohh...
- Hey, hey, easy.

1345
01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:34.598
It's time all of you realised who kept
the daggers out of your backs.

1346
01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.718
Show some fucking respect.
I... I've got... I've got...

1347
01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:40.157
I've got documents.
I have documents on all of you.

1348
01:19:40.159 --> 01:19:41.998
You, 13th of March, 1937.

1349
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.317
Zolotov trials.
Forty-two dead, 173 exiled.

1350
01:19:45.319 --> 01:19:47.197
- Your signature.
- Beria, that's enough!

1351
01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:49.878
Yeah, well, you signed off
the life of your own brother!

1352
01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.437
Oh, you think that was easy?
You bastard!

1353
01:19:52.439 --> 01:19:53.718
Bagrov, Gorev.

1354
01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.918
How did your conscience
accommodate that?

1355
01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:59.477
And Zykov! Zykov!
Poor blameless, guileless Zykov.

1356
01:19:59.479 --> 01:20:00.559
All of you!

1357
01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.199
All of you.
I have documents on all of you!

1358
01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.678
I've seen what you've done.

1359
01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:07.437
I know the truth.
It's all written down.

1360
01:20:07.439 --> 01:20:11.479
It's all written down on a very...
on a very fucking long list!

1361
01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.600
Just pick them up.

1362
01:20:17.239 --> 01:20:18.678
Are we done? Hm?

1363
01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:22.317
We will convene
tomorrow after the funeral.

1364
01:20:22.319 --> 01:20:24.477
I will nominate some scapegoats.

1365
01:20:24.479 --> 01:20:27.357
We can arraign a couple
of the officers who fired.

1366
01:20:27.359 --> 01:20:28.638
- No harm done.
- Are you okay?

1367
01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:31.718
Only comrades and friends
could shout at each other like this.

1368
01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:34.237
Right, so we'll fix this
in committee, all right?

1369
01:20:34.239 --> 01:20:37.277
Right, right...
He's using you, Georgy.

1370
01:20:37.279 --> 01:20:39.357
He's using you
and then he's gonna kill you.

1371
01:20:39.359 --> 01:20:42.237
- You saw those papers.
- What are you talking about?

1372
01:20:42.239 --> 01:20:45.357
Jesus, Nicky, he was pointing at you.
He wasn't pointing at me.

1373
01:20:45.359 --> 01:20:46.798
No, he said "all of you".

1374
01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.718
No, no.
I was over there, you know?

1375
01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.638
- And he went "all of you".
- Yeah, "all of you".

1376
01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.758
- No, no.
- Yes.

1377
01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.678
- "All of you."
- All of us.

1378
01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:59.157
No, he said "all of you".

1379
01:20:59.159 --> 01:21:03.477
You know, all of you
can kiss my Russian arse.

1380
01:21:03.479 --> 01:21:04.759
All of you.

1381
01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.000
On the balcony. Let's go.

1382
01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:24.237
Why did Molotov
want to meet us at dawn?

1383
01:21:24.239 --> 01:21:27.237
- Is he planning a duel?
- Said he wanted to start early.

1384
01:21:27.239 --> 01:21:28.399
Murderer!

1385
01:21:29.159 --> 01:21:31.357
You killed hundreds, Nicky.

1386
01:21:31.359 --> 01:21:33.519
You certainly got your big funeral.

1387
01:21:34.279 --> 01:21:36.718
- I'm regretting this already.
- Get in the car.

1388
01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.157
- What?
- Can't talk. Get in the car.

1389
01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:48.077
I see she moults.

1390
01:21:48.079 --> 01:21:50.918
This is for hungry ears.

1391
01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:53.758
The drivers.

1392
01:21:56.359 --> 01:21:58.159
Let's do him in.

1393
01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.117
- Who?
- Beria.

1394
01:22:00.119 --> 01:22:02.638
The treacherous snake
brought back the bishops.

1395
01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.157
He brought back Polina.

1396
01:22:04.159 --> 01:22:06.477
He expressly ignored
all Stalin's orders.

1397
01:22:06.479 --> 01:22:08.799
His men opened fire
on innocent people.

1398
01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.638
He'll get the blame.
Clever, eh, Nicky?

1399
01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.518
Yes, Beria is the murderer here.

1400
01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.798
This is how the Soviet Union
was built. Not with bishops.

1401
01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:21.157
Today Beria gets
an eight-foot crucifix up his arse.

1402
01:22:21.159 --> 01:22:23.037
- Good.
- I've...

1403
01:22:23.039 --> 01:22:25.798
I've had nightmares
that made more sense than this.

1404
01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.678
- Now we have a majority.
- Yes, you do.

1405
01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:32.880
- You two, me and Bulganin.
- Mikoyan and Malenkov.

1406
01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.998
- No... but we still have a majority.
- No, no, no.

1407
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.397
Everyone in or not at all.

1408
01:22:37.399 --> 01:22:41.037
Oh, come on. Slava, you just...
Dammit, you just said...

1409
01:22:41.039 --> 01:22:43.077
- All in or it's off.
- No...

1410
01:22:43.079 --> 01:22:47.197
This is what Stalin would have wanted.
The Committee as one.

1411
01:22:47.199 --> 01:22:51.277
But you've got to act fast, comrade.
Act fast or be dead.

1412
01:22:51.279 --> 01:22:53.918
Yes, Uncle Nicky's going to be dead

1413
01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.918
if he doesn't get a move on, isn't he?

1414
01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.239
Yes, he is.

1415
01:22:58.439 --> 01:23:00.039
How's my guest?

1416
01:23:00.479 --> 01:23:02.639
Yes, I'm working on my speech.
It's good.

1417
01:23:03.119 --> 01:23:04.279
I've brought you something.

1418
01:23:06.279 --> 01:23:07.598
No.

1419
01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.558
I'm not drinking.
I'm using water.

1420
01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.477
It's just to calm your nerves.

1421
01:23:11.479 --> 01:23:12.878
Yes, actually,
I will need some of that.

1422
01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.400
- No. He's not drinking.
- No, I'm not drinking.

1423
01:23:16.279 --> 01:23:18.998
- How's the speech?
- Um... ba-dum-ba-dum...

1424
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.119
My father...

1425
01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.240
...was a warm and mighty bear,

1426
01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:29.598
and we are his 170 million
orphaned cubs.

1427
01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:33.558
Russian cubs, Georgian cubs,
Armenian cubs, Lithuanian...

1428
01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.798
We'll leave you to it. Come on.

1429
01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.718
So, Lithuanian cubs,

1430
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.878
Ukrainian cubs, Moldavian cubs...

1431
01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.039
Svetlana.

1432
01:23:44.439 --> 01:23:45.799
Alexei's dead.

1433
01:23:50.279 --> 01:23:52.000
15th of March, 1949.

1434
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.477
Attempted escape from Kolyma
with 12 others.

1435
01:23:56.479 --> 01:23:57.998
Executed. I'm sorry.

1436
01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.918
But you said you would get him back.

1437
01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:05.197
Listen, it was outside my direct
control. It just wasn't possible.

1438
01:24:05.199 --> 01:24:07.918
Yes, but you said that
you would attempt the impossible.

1439
01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.840
I hate being sober. It's a terrible,
terrible mood to be in.

1440
01:24:13.119 --> 01:24:14.397
Why don't we go through that speech

1441
01:24:14.399 --> 01:24:15.798
- one more time?
- Sit down.

1442
01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.237
Get off me.
I can see what you're doing.

1443
01:24:17.239 --> 01:24:18.639
- I don't want to sit down.
- Sit down.

1444
01:24:19.399 --> 01:24:21.079
I don't want to sit down!

1445
01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:29.277
Right, many terrible things were done
in the service of the Union.

1446
01:24:29.279 --> 01:24:31.237
Evidence was fabricated.

1447
01:24:31.239 --> 01:24:33.838
Those who are responsible
will be found...

1448
01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:36.397
And what will you do to them?
Question them to death?

1449
01:24:36.399 --> 01:24:37.518
You know what I'm doing?

1450
01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.798
I'm offering you and
that bloated soak my protection.

1451
01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:43.800
- We are not children!
- You are a real listener. Thank you.

1452
01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:47.718
- I am not a child.
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

1453
01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:51.838
And I warn you, stick by my side
or you will both be beaten inside out

1454
01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.918
and strung up
for the crows by the others.

1455
01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.157
Why should I trust you?

1456
01:24:55.159 --> 01:24:57.279
Because I'm the only one
who's telling you.

1457
01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.000
Trust no-one.

1458
01:25:11.119 --> 01:25:14.798
Georgy, Georgy.
Georgy, we have to act today.

1459
01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.157
Act, you limpet?

1460
01:25:16.159 --> 01:25:19.798
Act sombre, act respectful
like the rest of us, please.

1461
01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.758
Do you understand
how important this is?

1462
01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.878
- Would you...
- Places, comrades, please.

1463
01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:26.037
Form up either side of the...
Comrade, thank you very much.

1464
01:25:26.039 --> 01:25:28.277
If you could join
your comrades over here.

1465
01:25:28.279 --> 01:25:29.559
- Thank you.
- Damn it.

1466
01:25:35.199 --> 01:25:37.317
All right, guys, come on. Lift it up.

1467
01:25:37.319 --> 01:25:39.518
- That's it.
- Come on. Let's go.

1468
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.678
- Which foot?
- Left foot.

1469
01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.077
I don't have a good balance.

1470
01:25:42.079 --> 01:25:43.397
Okay. Yes.

1471
01:25:43.399 --> 01:25:45.079
Ooh. Argh.

1472
01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:50.638
Georgy...

1473
01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:53.838
Not now. God sakes.

1474
01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:59.520
- Georgy, we really have to talk.
- Shut up. Have some respect.

1475
01:26:00.119 --> 01:26:02.838
- Is Malenkov on board?
- Yes, 100 percent.

1476
01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:04.477
Saddle up, cowboy.

1477
01:26:04.479 --> 01:26:08.357
- Is Malenkov with us?
- Trust me, 100 percent.

1478
01:26:08.359 --> 01:26:09.758
Yes!

1479
01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:12.598
- So you're on board, then, Molotov?
- Yeah.

1480
01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.758
Okay. You've got me, then, Nicky.

1481
01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:18.237
Put your dancing shoes on.

1482
01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:20.840
- Which way shall I...
- Left.

1483
01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:22.878
All right.

1484
01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:26.239
Okay, let's go and catch
a pig for the pot.

1485
01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.718
Stalin's love of the nation
was unwavering.

1486
01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:36.798
So must we now take
our unwavering pain,

1487
01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:40.357
our unwavering love,

1488
01:26:40.359 --> 01:26:45.918
and with it build an unwavering,
unwavering... future.

1489
01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.918
Guns, please, gentlemen.

1490
01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:51.197
Take good care of this.
Don't want it going off.

1491
01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:55.477
Today we pause.
We pause in grief and sorrow.

1492
01:26:55.479 --> 01:26:59.119
But is not a pause in itself
part of the revolution?

1493
01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.117
I think it is.

1494
01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:07.037
Okay, let's tango.

1495
01:27:07.039 --> 01:27:08.758
You heard him, gentlemen. Let's go.

1496
01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:11.117
We must embrace our terrible loss

1497
01:27:11.119 --> 01:27:13.760
with the strength and love
for our nation...

1498
01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:17.037
that Stalin himself held

1499
01:27:17.039 --> 01:27:18.479
in his mighty heart.

1500
01:27:20.399 --> 01:27:21.639
Check the stalls.

1501
01:27:23.399 --> 01:27:26.037
We promise you rights and liberties...

1502
01:27:26.039 --> 01:27:28.638
bread... and peace.

1503
01:27:31.119 --> 01:27:34.479
My father
was a great social scientist.

1504
01:27:35.079 --> 01:27:38.317
But we,
the people of the Soviet Union,

1505
01:27:38.319 --> 01:27:40.399
are not laboratory animals.

1506
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.640
We are all but cubs.

1507
01:27:46.439 --> 01:27:48.197
Russian cubs,

1508
01:27:48.199 --> 01:27:50.277
Georgian cubs,

1509
01:27:50.279 --> 01:27:52.638
Armenian cubs,

1510
01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:54.477
Lithuanian cubs...

1511
01:27:54.479 --> 01:27:57.039
Latvian cubs...

1512
01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.760
Estonian cubs.

1513
01:28:08.239 --> 01:28:10.718
- Very good speech, Lavrenti.
- Thank you.

1514
01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:13.437
Yes, "bread and peace".
I knew it would work.

1515
01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:15.880
It was between "peace" and "sausages".

1516
01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:20.280
Both good things, but you know
where you are with a sausage.

1517
01:28:21.159 --> 01:28:25.277
Your name rings out.
Malenkov the hero. Good lad.

1518
01:28:25.279 --> 01:28:27.237
Vasily's face
when the planes flew over.

1519
01:28:28.399 --> 01:28:30.598
Should have strafed the little shit.

1520
01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.477
Poor Vasily. I sometimes wonder
if he's meant for this world.

1521
01:28:33.479 --> 01:28:36.397
I salute you, Top Boy,
and I salute your haircut.

1522
01:28:36.399 --> 01:28:38.439
- Goodnight, Vienna.
- Georgy.

1523
01:28:40.159 --> 01:28:42.197
Action is gonna be taken
at the meeting.

1524
01:28:42.199 --> 01:28:43.359
Action? What action?

1525
01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:47.240
Is this why everyone is treating me
like they wanna fuck my sister?

1526
01:28:48.439 --> 01:28:50.878
Zhukov has everybody on board
against Beria.

1527
01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:52.558
- When I heard that, I agreed too.
- Yes, yes.

1528
01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:57.317
But Zhukov...
is not governing the Soviet Union.

1529
01:28:57.319 --> 01:29:00.477
I am governing the Soviet Union.

1530
01:29:00.479 --> 01:29:02.277
- Do you understand that?
- Yes.

1531
01:29:02.279 --> 01:29:05.518
Now, I like him and I'll be happy
to listen to what he has to say.

1532
01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.798
You'll definitely have a chance
to talk to him.

1533
01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:11.197
Perhaps what we can do
is give Beria a slight demotion,

1534
01:29:11.199 --> 01:29:13.559
I don't know, Ministry for Fisheries.

1535
01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:19.359
All right, boys.
Meet your dates for tonight.

1536
01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:21.480
I'll take the tall blonde.

1537
01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:26.037
Comrades, time to set aside our grief

1538
01:29:26.039 --> 01:29:29.878
and begin to write the next chapter
of our great history.

1539
01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.718
- Comrade Malenkov...
- Proceed.

1540
01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:34.317
Item one, the unfortunate events
of yesterday evening.

1541
01:29:34.319 --> 01:29:37.918
It's clear that the regrettable deaths
of so many citizens...

1542
01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:41.397
Comrades. Comrades,
I would like to propose a new agenda.

1543
01:29:41.399 --> 01:29:43.878
Item one,
the conduct of Comrade Beria.

1544
01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:46.277
Seconded. Time to take stock.

1545
01:29:46.279 --> 01:29:48.558
If you have
a serious proposal, comrade,

1546
01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.918
I suggest "Any Other Business".

1547
01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:51.437
I accuse Comrade Beria

1548
01:29:51.439 --> 01:29:53.477
of centralising power
within his Ministry

1549
01:29:53.479 --> 01:29:55.518
at the expense of the Party
and Central Committee...

1550
01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:58.197
- There's no tabled motion.
- ...betraying the Soviet Union.

1551
01:29:58.199 --> 01:30:00.918
I deplore this wanton
breach of protocol. Georgy.

1552
01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:03.638
Breach, my arse!
This is an ad hoc motion.

1553
01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:06.558
It will end very badly for you.
Georgy, Georgy!

1554
01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.998
Georgy, press the button
underneath the desk.

1555
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.077
- Press the button, Georgy.
- What button?

1556
01:30:11.079 --> 01:30:13.000
- Arrest that madman.
- Where's the button?

1557
01:30:15.359 --> 01:30:17.518
Good luck, ladies.

1558
01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:18.878
Guards!

1559
01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.678
Guards!

1560
01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:24.477
Hands up or
I'll shoot you in the face.

1561
01:30:24.479 --> 01:30:25.838
Guards!

1562
01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.317
Oh, shit.

1563
01:30:27.319 --> 01:30:28.920
- Guards!
- Oi!

1564
01:30:32.279 --> 01:30:34.239
Want a job done properly,
you call the army.

1565
01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.237
Take his belt off.

1566
01:30:36.239 --> 01:30:37.998
It's hard to run away
with your pants falling down.

1567
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.518
If you want to talk to General Zhukov,
now's your opportunity.

1568
01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:43.160
Spit it out, Georgy.
Staging a coup here.

1569
01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:45.437
He's got a knife by his ankle.

1570
01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:48.237
- You're a disgrace.
- Give his head a good kicking.

1571
01:30:48.239 --> 01:30:50.277
- Make you feel better.
- All in good time.

1572
01:30:50.279 --> 01:30:55.838
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy peeling the skin
from your self-satisfied face.

1573
01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.397
Not with that, you won't.
Come on, then.

1574
01:31:04.119 --> 01:31:05.920
Sorry, comrades.

1575
01:31:06.439 --> 01:31:08.197
- Wrong room.
- Aslanov.

1576
01:31:08.199 --> 01:31:09.998
- Go and kill them.
- Kobulov.

1577
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.357
- Shall we?
- Yes, right.

1578
01:31:11.359 --> 01:31:13.119
Let's do this.
Georgy, come on, now.

1579
01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.560
Suit doesn't really work
without this belt.

1580
01:31:23.359 --> 01:31:24.479
Oh, shit.

1581
01:31:28.479 --> 01:31:30.998
Third door on the left. On the left.

1582
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.037
I have been picturing this moment

1583
01:31:33.039 --> 01:31:35.399
every day for the last three decades.

1584
01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:39.317
Arrest the staff.
Arrest all Beria's staff.

1585
01:31:39.319 --> 01:31:41.678
Check the bedrooms.

1586
01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:43.638
Come out. You're safe.
This way. Come out this way.

1587
01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.277
You're safe. Come out.

1588
01:31:45.279 --> 01:31:47.319
- You, take her down.
- This way.

1589
01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:51.558
Is this magisterial
enough for you all?

1590
01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.558
This charade? This is a lavatory!

1591
01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:56.518
Well, you should feel at home, then,
you little coil of shit.

1592
01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:57.598
Fuck me.

1593
01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:00.998
Georgy's eyes really do follow
you round the crapper. It's weird.

1594
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.157
Why did they hang a picture
of my grandmother in here?

1595
01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:07.117
This is madness.
This is madness.

1596
01:32:07.119 --> 01:32:09.838
- He deserves a trial.
- He'll get a trial. Take it easy.

1597
01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:12.518
Georgy!
Can't even look me in the eye.

1598
01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:15.117
- Guilt. Guilty, all of you.
- Say nothing.

1599
01:32:15.119 --> 01:32:18.558
Georgy, you'll get over it.
I did. Took me about five minutes.

1600
01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:21.598
H-How long before the army's here?
We're in complete limbo now.

1601
01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:24.918
Not long. We have to wait
for the NKVD to leave the Kremlin.

1602
01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:29.117
In that case, if nobody objects,
I'm going to spend a kopeck.

1603
01:32:29.119 --> 01:32:30.800
It's the excitement, I think.

1604
01:32:34.199 --> 01:32:35.638
Right, hold your fire.

1605
01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:38.157
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

1606
01:32:38.159 --> 01:32:40.199
The army's back.
Did you miss us?

1607
01:32:43.479 --> 01:32:45.519
- Take their weapons.
- Come on, this way.

1608
01:32:48.399 --> 01:32:51.759
All right, Judy Garland,
boys and girls. It's showtime.

1609
01:32:54.119 --> 01:32:55.237
Georgy.

1610
01:32:55.239 --> 01:32:58.558
- Georgy, you have to sign this now.
- No. No.

1611
01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.560
No. He deserves a fair trial.
He's one of us.

1612
01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:06.197
What about Tukhachevsky
and Piatakov?

1613
01:33:06.199 --> 01:33:07.838
Did they get a trial?

1614
01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.680
What about Sokolnikov?

1615
01:33:10.159 --> 01:33:12.397
Who begged him to look after
his elderly mother.

1616
01:33:12.399 --> 01:33:15.519
And what did this monster do?
He strangled her in front of him.

1617
01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:18.680
It's too late.

1618
01:33:19.239 --> 01:33:22.800
The only choice we have
is between his death or his revenge.

1619
01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:25.680
And you will fucking sign this.

1620
01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:39.519
I want it to go on record:

1621
01:33:40.159 --> 01:33:42.079
this was not my first
course of action.

1622
01:33:45.079 --> 01:33:47.000
Stalin would be loving this.

1623
01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:54.920
Through the door.

1624
01:33:57.359 --> 01:34:00.357
- Get the table.
- Let me through.

1625
01:34:00.359 --> 01:34:02.759
Sit him down here. Sit him down.

1626
01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.718
- All right, all right.
- This... This is a travesty!

1627
01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:09.678
You are all witnesses to a criminal...
criminal travesty.

1628
01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.798
Come on!

1629
01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:14.598
I demand... I demand... Fuck you!

1630
01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:17.197
I demand my rights under Article...

1631
01:34:17.199 --> 01:34:20.437
- Will you stop banging?
- Read it, Georgy.

1632
01:34:20.439 --> 01:34:22.197
- Here's your trial.
- Spit it out.

1633
01:34:22.199 --> 01:34:24.638
- Marshal?
- Comrade General Secretary!

1634
01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:27.037
- Get on with it!
- Read it.

1635
01:34:27.039 --> 01:34:29.397
You're judging me!
You're judging me!

1636
01:34:29.399 --> 01:34:30.598
- I judge you!
- Fuck you!

1637
01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:34.117
I judge you!
I judge all of you. All of you.

1638
01:34:34.119 --> 01:34:36.277
- Where's the logic?
- Nicky, read it.

1639
01:34:36.279 --> 01:34:37.638
Would you like me to read it for you?

1640
01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:39.998
- Read it, Nicky.
- Come on, Nicky, read it.

1641
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.918
"You are accused

1642
01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:44.037
"of using your position
as Minister of the Interior

1643
01:34:44.039 --> 01:34:46.317
- "to plot against the Soviet Union...
- Traitor!

1644
01:34:46.319 --> 01:34:50.117
...with the goal of forwarding
the interests of foreign powers."

1645
01:34:50.119 --> 01:34:52.638
Foreign powers?
Which one, the fucking moon?

1646
01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:55.998
"You are also accused
of 347 counts of rape,

1647
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.758
"of sexual deviancy
and bourgeois immorality

1648
01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:03.678
and acts of perversion with children
as young as seven years old."

1649
01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:05.237
Exotic for old Beria!

1650
01:35:05.239 --> 01:35:07.237
Seven years old!

1651
01:35:07.239 --> 01:35:10.077
Rapists! Rapists! You are the rapists!

1652
01:35:10.079 --> 01:35:11.798
Error! Error! Error!

1653
01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:13.838
- Get on with it.
- "Petra Nikova, aged 13.

1654
01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:18.437
"Nadia Ranova, aged 14.
Magya Holovic, aged seven."

1655
01:35:18.439 --> 01:35:20.518
Would you like to read
the list yourself?

1656
01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:24.317
"You are accused of treason
and anti-Soviet behaviour.

1657
01:35:24.319 --> 01:35:27.357
The court finds you guilty
and sentences you to be shot."

1658
01:35:27.359 --> 01:35:29.758
I rescind that.

1659
01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.357
Take him out.

1660
01:35:31.359 --> 01:35:32.599
No, please!

1661
01:35:33.199 --> 01:35:35.758
Please, don't shoot me!
Don't hurt me.

1662
01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:38.598
Shoot him!

1663
01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:40.277
Get him out. Come on!

1664
01:35:40.279 --> 01:35:42.319
Get out of here...

1665
01:35:45.279 --> 01:35:46.559
Well, that's got it done.

1666
01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.159
Come on, have a look.

1667
01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:52.878
Come on.

1668
01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.918
This is for us.
This is for the people.

1669
01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:56.440
Everybody happy? Proper dead?

1670
01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:00.197
- Ruined everything, Lavrenti.
- Come on, get him up.

1671
01:36:00.199 --> 01:36:02.237
Fuck off back to Georgia, deadboy.

1672
01:36:02.239 --> 01:36:04.157
- On the rocks.
- It was shit knowing you.

1673
01:36:04.159 --> 01:36:05.239
Who's got a light?

1674
01:36:06.479 --> 01:36:07.679
Get the cans.

1675
01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:12.119
I wish the old man
could have seen this.

1676
01:36:16.199 --> 01:36:17.319
That'll do.

1677
01:36:22.359 --> 01:36:23.880
Fucking hell.

1678
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.079
I'm knackered.
It's been a busy old week.

1679
01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:32.197
You see? Old Molotov's
still got some scheming left in him.

1680
01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.157
I will bury you in history.

1681
01:36:39.159 --> 01:36:42.437
- You hear me, you fat fucker?
- That's enough.

1682
01:36:42.439 --> 01:36:43.879
That's enough. Come on, now.

1683
01:36:45.119 --> 01:36:48.199
You smell like rendered horse,
you burning arsehole.

1684
01:36:50.359 --> 01:36:52.359
That's how you deal with a problem,
isn't it?

1685
01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.277
I'm sorry you had to be here.

1686
01:36:56.279 --> 01:36:59.197
I hope you didn't tell Beria that
he was going to be safe from harm.

1687
01:36:59.199 --> 01:37:02.838
You will be safe, okay?
Vasily, too. If you listen to me.

1688
01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:05.117
Why wouldn't we be safe?

1689
01:37:05.119 --> 01:37:07.397
- What are you talking about?
- Just be quiet now.

1690
01:37:07.399 --> 01:37:10.039
- I refuse to be quiet every time...
- Just shut up!

1691
01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:15.039
Vasily stays here in Russia
where we can take care of him.

1692
01:37:16.479 --> 01:37:17.679
Read it.

1693
01:37:18.439 --> 01:37:19.599
Vienna?

1694
01:37:24.279 --> 01:37:26.437
- If I stayed, I could contain Vasily.
- No. No.

1695
01:37:26.439 --> 01:37:29.277
No, you go to Vienna. He stays.

1696
01:37:29.279 --> 01:37:31.277
We can't have a drunken madman

1697
01:37:31.279 --> 01:37:33.317
spreading conspiracy theories
all over the world.

1698
01:37:33.319 --> 01:37:35.437
- He's not... He's not bad.
- Listen to me.

1699
01:37:35.439 --> 01:37:38.479
- He's just ill.
- No. No.

1700
01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:42.320
You understand what's going on?

1701
01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:47.119
This is how people get killed,
when their stories don't fit.

1702
01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:50.920
Safe travels.

1703
01:37:55.319 --> 01:37:56.719
I never thought it would be you.

1704
01:38:04.039 --> 01:38:05.439
Now we can turn the corner.

1705
01:38:06.279 --> 01:38:09.599
Yeah.
Put all the bloodshed behind us.

1706
01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:17.640
I'm worried about Malenkov, though.

1707
01:38:20.159 --> 01:38:21.359
Can we trust him?

1708
01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.720
Can you ever trust a weak man?

1709
01:39:33.385 --> 01:39:38.385
