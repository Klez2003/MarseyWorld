WEBVTT

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.600
Yeah?

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.140
Can you turn down the music.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.100
What?

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.620
Can you turn down the music!

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.140
I'm trying to get some sleep here!

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.800
Turn down the music?

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.100
How's that!

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.100
How's that.  Is that much better?

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.400
Turn down your damn music, or I'll come over there and turn it down myself!

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.300
All right, sucker.  You come down here, we can dance.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.800
Hello?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.340
Hello?

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.400
Bitch!

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.800
When I don't get enough sleep, I get
irritable.  And you don't want to make me -

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.500
'Calling VAGAN'

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.800
Wait! Who are you?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.760
Just a bean trying to
get some sleep.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.240
You came here just to make us turn off
the music?

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.900
If you were listening on the phone,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.380
I said I would come here to turn
it off myself.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.800
What!

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.660
Are you insane?!  Do you know what you
just got yourself into?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.900
Do you know who I am!

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.700
Do you know who my uncle is?!

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.460
Yes.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.600
I do.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.380
Detective Cromwell.  Good morning.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.440
Yeah.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.000
Something tells me there's nothing good about this morning.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.320
What do we got here?

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.700
Multiple gunshots were reported coming from this warehouse.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.860
I was the first one to answer the call.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.700
Multiple gunshots, huh.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.980
You do know whose warehouse this is.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.740
Yes, sir.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.540
Have you gone inside yet?

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.660
No, sir.  I wanted to wait for backup.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.560
Well.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.260
It's here.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.180
My God.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.940
What a massacre.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.800
There's got to be a
dozen, at least a dozen dead beans here.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.840
I guess I don't need this anymore.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.620
These were all Cappuccino's beans.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.720
Mm-hmm.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.820
It must have been some kind of gang war.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.200
No.  This is no gang war.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.640
Cappuccino's beans might be dumb, but they know how to use a gun.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.920
There would have been other dead beans
here, not just them.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.440
This something else.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.960
Well.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.600
One thing's for sure.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.300
We won't need that search warrant we were trying to get, huh.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.360
Heh.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.100
Yeah.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.480
I could live with this.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.220
Detective Cromwell.  I found something here.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:40.079
'This bullet casing is the property of Killer Bean'

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.300
Killer Bean

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.600
'The bullet is meant for someone else'

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.140
Hmm.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.460
What do you make of this?

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.280
This guy's got balls.  That's for sure.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.460
We got company!

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.100
Let's go!

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.860
Stop!

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.160
Stop right there!

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.700
This is the police!  Hold it right there!

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.440
Bad idea.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.560
Get out of the car!  Get your hands where I
can see them!

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.720
Easy...  Easy...

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.780
Oh please, officer. Don't hurt me.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.960
Watch it.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.720
Vagan.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.660
I should have known I'd find you
here, Detective Cromwell.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.460
What are you doing here, Vagan?

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.760
Well, obviously something happened in my warehouse.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.980
I mean, can't a bean protect his own property anymore?

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.040
Don't you mean, Cappuccino's property?

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.080
You know, your obsession with Cappuccino has become quite amusing.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.600
Always trying to link everything back to Cappuccino.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.320
Why don't you tell it to the court.  You're
under arrest.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.970
Arrest?  For what?

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.020
A traffic violation?

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.160
What about this?
Looking for some action here?

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.480
If I were looking for some action,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.340
you wouldn't be standing before me as you do right now.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.460
Yeah?

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.900
That's cause I'd be shooting you with this!

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.400
Are you kids done yet?

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.380
I say we take him in and book him right now.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.820
You know my lawyers will have me out even before you get me to the police station.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.700
The time is not worth your effort, now is it Cromwell.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.340
Let him go.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.220
What?!

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.400
I said let him go.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.700
Uh, my gun please.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.820
Nice...

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.580
You know, Vagan, you're right.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.380
You're not worth my time.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.900
However, investigating the multiple
homicides in your warehouse is.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:35.100
And whatever else we find in your warehouse,
is just icing on the cake.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.780
You're free to go.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.880
And by the way, your car's parked illegally.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.200
You better get it out of here before we tow it.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.100
Oh, and Vagan.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.820
Here.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.300
It looks like I'm not the only one after your boss.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:28.820
...possible suspects. Rumors have surfaced saying that there is a vigilante bean in town...

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.740
What the hell is going on out there?!

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.800
Ah.  Looks like I got someone's attention.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.680
Who's this?

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.220
Great.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.760
Playtime's over.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.040
'Encrypted Call'

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.520
'Decoding'

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.880
'Secure Connection'

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.460
This is Killer Bean.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:32.060
Killer Bean.  What the hell are you doing? You think this is a game?

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.140
What were you thinking last night?

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.440
I had a rough night last night.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:41.020
We know what kind of night you had.  Might I remind you what your mission is.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:46.640
You were given specific orders to hunt down and eliminate the target.  No one else!

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:52.420
Drawing this kind of attention to yourself is dangerous for us, and especially for you.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.980
What's the big deal?  I killed a bunch of
gangsters.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.200
I'm sure the Beantown police are a lot
happier without them.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.880
You didn't do anyone a favor with that mess you created last night.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.560
And you are not working for the Beantown police.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.760
You are working for us!

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.060
I'll still get the job done.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.560
I'll get him.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.880
We're running out of time.  He has to know you're coming by now.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.940
Remember who he is.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.580
Yeah.  I know what the mission is.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.680
Then stick to it!  Don't be so reckless, Killer Bean.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.080
I'll call you when I got him!

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.760
Reckless!  Pff!

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.660
Reckless my brown bean ass!

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.440
'Decoding'

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.800
'Secure Connection'

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.920
Yes?

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.060
Jet Bean, you have been activated for an urgent mission in Beantown.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.520
Beantown? I'm a long way from Beantown.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.780
It would be best to assign someone else.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.960
This mission is highly sensitive.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.800
You are the most capable for the job.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.000
It figures.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.100
Fine.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.480
I'll do it.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.280
Good.  We'll contact you with the details
as soon as you reach the shore.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.660
See you in Beantown.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.380
They better have some good food in Beantown.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.640
Wait.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.580
Are you leaving?

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.100
Yes.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.040
How long will you go for?

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.680
A long time.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.320
Oh...

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.119
I have something I want to give to you.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:11.759
Oh... You shouldn't have.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.260
Here!  It's the bill!

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.200
You haven't paid in three months!

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:21.339
I'm leaving now.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:24.839
I will pay when I get back.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.559
Hey! You get back here pay now!

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.640
Tsingtao!

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.840
Get out here!

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.120
He say your food tastes like ass crack.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.960
What?!

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.360
Make bean curd out of him!

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:53.160
I said I'll pay when I get back!

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.300
Oh.  It's okay.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.320
It's on the house.  You don't have to come
back!  Please!

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.940
Looking at the figures from our previous fiscal year.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.800
Narcotic sales have dropped 57 percent.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.940
57 percent!

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.840
That's more than half!

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.980
Now, compare this to the 300 percent growth

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.140
from our weapons department.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.380
But you guys...

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:35.040
You guys are not from my weapons department, are you.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.440
No...

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.460
You guys are from my narcotics department, okay?!

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.380
So what do I have to do, huh?

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.800
How can I get through to you guys?!

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.780
Dude.  I have such a hangover.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:55.380
Yeah bean, that was a kick-ass party last night, right?

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.940
Yeah.  Too bad we didn't stay
for the whole thing.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.940
I bet they had some fun.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.640
Woot!  Woot!

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.820
You see, it's easy when you think about it.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.320
Crime is on the rise, okay.  So more guns sell,

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.220
because criminals use guns.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.880
Hello!!

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.000
They also use drugs!

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.640
So more drugs should sell, right?

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.140
What's the problem here?

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.240
Now, you guys.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.640
Someone give me a reasonable explanation, okay?

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:35.580
Why are narcotic sales performing so poorly?

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.780
It's all those anti-drug commercials on TV.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.480
You never see any anti-gun commercials.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.300
It's not fair.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.680
It has become quite apparent to me,

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.880
that some of you do not value your job.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.060
Now...

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.680
That is quite odd, if you ask me.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.260
Especially in today's economy.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.560
But I am forced to say...

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.020
It is time...

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.340
To lay off!

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.680
A few beans!!

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.140
Ooohhh!!!

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.240
Uh, wait.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.580
I have a question.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.740
Yes.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.300
Will I be eligible for unemployment?

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.500
Hmm.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.520
Let me check with the finance department on that, okay?

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.780
My social security number is...

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.720
3, 4, 6...

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.280
Oh boy.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.820
Is my batting average going to go up after this.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.160
Ahem-

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.680
Hang on, let me just finish this level.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.580
Cappuccino!

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.240
Ah.  Vagan.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.960
I'm glad you're here.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.340
Maybe you can teach these beans something about business,

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.100
since you've handled my weapons department so well.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.420
That bean is nothing but a kiss-ass
brown-noser.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.760
What does he know that we don't know?

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.060
But he's making millions of dollars selling weapons.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.560
If you ask me,

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.980
He's doing something illegal.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.080
Oh, it's great to see you, Vagan.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.080
But you'll have to excuse me.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.060
I'm in an important meeting right now.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.380
This is more important.  It's about the warehouse on Baker Street.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.280
Oh that.  It's okay.  I know.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.620
You know?

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.440
Yeah.  My nephew was having a
party of there last night, okay?

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.120
No, it's not about the party.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.300
Well.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.220
It is.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.100
There was a hit on the warehouse.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.480
Everyone is dead.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.460
Who did this.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:02.740
I have reason to believe that it was done by a bean named, Killer Bean.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.480
Killer Bean...

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.120
One bean?

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.460
This is no ordinary bean.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:14.540
I've heard of him before. I know what he can do.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.820
Who the hell is he?

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.460
Who sent him?

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.260
Is it the Colombians?

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.120
Is it the French trying to roast me?

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.820
It has to be one of your competitors.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.820
Who ever it is,

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.240
I want you to find him.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.780
I want you to find him, and destroy him!

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.340
Oh, believe me I will try.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.520
But first, we have Killer Bean to deal with.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.160
He's somewhere out there, and he's coming
after you.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.360
All right.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.960
We need to consolidate all of our warehouses.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.740
There's too many targets for him to attack.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.880
Move all our inventory to the central
warehouse on Main Street.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.720
I want you to protect that place.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.340
What about Killer Bean?  What do you want me to do?

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.040
Oh nothing.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:09.220
Just send him a box of chocolates, and tell him thanks for the memories.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.900
You idiot!

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.180
What do you think you should do?

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.540
Kill him.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.760
Any way you can, by any means.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.860
Put him in the ground!

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:25.040
I'll need more beans.  Professional beans.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.760
Put it on my credit card, okay.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.480
Just do it!

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.040
Yes, sir.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.980
Vagan.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.180
Make sure you find out who sent him.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.640
There will be hell to pay.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.280
Hello.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.540
Hey, Harry.  It's Detective Cromwell.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.660
Hey, Cromwell.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.320
Hey did you get the package I sent you?

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.980
Yeah, it's pretty wild stuff.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.640
Our crime lab is getting nowhere with this.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.920
What do you make of it?

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.700
Well, the easy ones the tire tread sample.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:24.800
I tested the residue you sent, and the tires are made from silicon steel fiber alloy.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:30.680
It's only used on high-performance cars. It's
not unique, but it's hard to come by.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.660
Hmm... What about the gold bullets?

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.960
Now that.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.740
In my 15 years with Special Forces, I've never seen gold used in any weapon.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.320
But for practical purposes gold is a very soft metal.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.840
So the bullets expand and deform on high impact.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.060
They make little holes on the way in and big holes on the way out.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.240
And they are much harder to match the ballistic signatures.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.200
That makes them relatively untraceable.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:03.360
Yeah, that doesn't make sense if the bullet casings have his name on it.  And he left those everywhere.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.240
Yeah.  Killer Bean.  Yeah, I
don't get that.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.920
He must be one sick bean, like he wanted
to be found out.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.520
Yeah, or he's bragging.  Or just plain careless.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:22.200
This Killer Bean has to be working for someone to get that kind of financial backing.  You think he's a gun for hire?

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.480
Or he could be a vigilante.  That's the word on the street.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.780
Either way, one thing's for sure.  He has his eyes set on Cappuccino.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:35.120
Heh, well then you both have something in common.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.400
Yeah.  If that's true,

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.640
I have a hunch where this Killer Bean will show up next.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.820
Hey, I gotta go.  See you, Harry.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.860
Later.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:57.480
'Suspected Cappuccino's Warehouses'

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:45.000
Dramatic entrance...  Dramatic entrance...

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.000
Well, that pretty much frees up my day.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.740
Time for some breakfast.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.200
'Shadow Bean, you are too late.'

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.520
Howdy.  What will it be?

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.540
Tequila and tonic.

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.480
And, uh.  Turn up the TV.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.600
Detective Cromwell, concerning possible suspects,

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:38.960
rumors have surfaced that there is a vigilante bean in town, who is hunting down Cappuccino.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.580
There is no evidence for your vigilante theory.  As far as I'm concerned,

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:48.020
the suspect or suspects involved in these
homicides are no friends of the police.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:52.120
We will do what is necessary to bring them to justice.  Thank you.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.980
I don't think so.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:59.020
I'll have another.  And you can turn that crap off now.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.460
What can I get you?

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.920
I'll have what he's having.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:54.140
This is a rough part of town.  Do you always sit with your back to the entrance?

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.860
Doesn't matter who comes in.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:08.240
Isn't it against police regulation to be drinking during the day?

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.340
I'm a detective.  Our regulations are a little different.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.860
How'd you know I was with the police?

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.520
You know, you're much uglier in person.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.680
Heh.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:23.240
My name is Detective Cromwell.  And you are?

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.120
Jack.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.340
Well, Jack...

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:33.060
I guess you heard what happened this morning over at the warehouse on Baker Street.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.320
Yeah, I know about that.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.740
Really.  Tell me what you know.

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.360
Why don't we cut to the chase.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.060
Why don't you tell me what you know.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.280
Oh, I know a lot.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.420
I know the Baker Street warehouse is owned by Cappuccino.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.580
I know someone killed 12 beans in that warehouse last night.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:57.680
I know the killer drove a fancy car, and has fancy guns.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:03.280
I know that the warehouse across the street with the big hole in the window also belongs to Cappuccino.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:08.520
I see this fancy car parked in front, and well, you don't look like you walked here.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.340
So my guess is...

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.960
This, belongs to you.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.840
Well it looks like you figured it all out.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.320
Good job.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.300
Another!

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:25.740
It was easy.  You were just reckless.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.920
The way I see it, you're the one who's being reckless.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:42.840
You come out here looking for me by yourself.  You didn't bring anyone to back you up.  That's reckless.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.460
Here's my backup.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.660
That's a nice gun.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.100
Wanna see mine!

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:23.360
How can I see it, if you have it against the side of my head?

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:33.239
Not bad.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:35.519
But mine's bigger.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.919
You do the math.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.739
Why are you after Cappuccino?

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:50.639
That's for me to know, and you not to know.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:55.559
Well, I know I can't have a crazy vigilante running around shooting up beans.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.120
But you're no vigilante, are you.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.780
Seems like there are beans who've invested in you,

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.180
And I'm sure they're not happy with the press you're getting.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.000
This is where I can help you.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.820
I don't need help.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.980
Well, you see.  I'm bound by the law.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.220
I've been working this Cappuccino case for over three years.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:30.840
Every time we think we have something on him, his lawyers get in the way and get him out.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.020
I wish I was like you.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.840
I wish I could just walk up to him and shoot him.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.900
But I can't.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.180
It's too bad.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.020
Because I know where is central warehouse is.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.840
Not these abandoned warehouses, like that
one out there.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.600
Why don't you pay him a visit?

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.880
You got the wrong bean.  I'm not just some hired gun.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.040
Who says I'm hiring you?

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.440
You already have a boss, don't you?

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:02.600
I bet he doesn't really like all that attention that you're getting from the media.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.640
I can make that go away.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.320
I control the evidence,

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:11.840
and the evidence says it could've been some rival gang that killed all of Cappuccino's beans last night, or...

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.980
It could be you.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.460
And I have a lot of evidence that says that.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.380
Are you going to take me in?

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.180
I can take you down.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.620
Oh... I would enjoy that.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.600
Freeze!

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.300
Get out of my bar you punks!  I know how to use this!

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.920
Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Hold on! I'm a cop!

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.340
Put down your gun!

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.800
I don't trust any of you.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.820
You drop your guns, both of you!

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.080
Sorry, grandpa.  It doesn't work like that.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.520
Okay, okay.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.800
I'm going to slowly lower my gun,

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.840
and I'm gonna go, alright?  Alright?

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.460
This will be real easy.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.080
See?

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.420
This is easy.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.520
Killer Bean.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.660
Remember what I said.

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.600
We can help each other.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.600
Just help yourself out the door.

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.700
This is for the drinks.  Mine and his.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.260
Now, you mind if I go to the bathroom before I go?

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.980
Be quick.  Your life depends on it.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.500
So dramatic.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.160
Sorry.  It was a double flusher.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:56.980
But you only flushed once.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.840
Hey... Don't I know you from somewhere?

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.740
Who is Shadow Bean?

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.400
You're in way over your head.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.680
Who is Shadow Bean?!

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.880
You don't have to yell.  I'm right next to you.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.900
Answer me!  Are there two of you?!

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.500
You're not going to shoot me if you need the answers.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.420
Besides, I can't answer you anyway.  So...

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.860
I'll have to do this instead!

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:55.540
It's a good idea for you to stay down.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.900
We'll settle this later.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.780
You're not as dumb as you look.

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:21.280
Hello.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.560
Harry.  It's Cromwell.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.160
My hunch was right.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.420
Killer Bean hit Cappuccino's warehouse on
the east side.

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.660
In fact, he was still here when I got here.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.640
Whoa, how did that go?

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.120
Not as well as I would have liked.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:40.700
Hey listen.  I got some new info. I found a note in front of Cappuccino's warehouse.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.140
It said, Shadow Bean, you are too late.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.700
Does that mean anything to you?

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.700
Harry?  You still there?

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:54.080
I didn't know they were still in operation.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.140
Who?

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:57.660
The Shadow Beans.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.080
Harry, what's going on?

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:06.220
They're highly trained operatives of an
organization called the Shadow Agency.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:12.180
Shadow Agency?  What are they, a government agency?  Why haven't I heard of them?

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.860
I think they were a private organization.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:19.100
There are some things the government does that are not meant to be known.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.720
Their collaboration with the Shadow Agency was one of them.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.460
When diplomatic and military tactics failed,

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:30.940
our government hired the Shadow Agency to eliminate national security threats.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:36.140
It was more cost effective than training and maintaining our own elite assassins.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:40.260
And the Shadow Beans were better than anything we had.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.500
Great.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.120
But why here?

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.620
What are the Shadow Beans doing in Beantown?

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.700
And what could they possibly want with Cappuccino?

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:53.540
I don't know.  I thought the Shadow Agency was disbanded.

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:57.160
I know our government stopped using them nearly a decade ago.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.220
I haven't heard of them since.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.320
So do you think this Killer Bean is a Shadow Bean operative?

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:06.340
It sounds like he's certainly good enough to be.

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.860
What do you think I should do is stop him?

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.760
I don't even know if you can't stop him.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:16.140
But you can start by putting all your cops on double duty.

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.920
Right...

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.900
This is the place.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.220
Dramatic entrance.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.400
Bean, I hate this job.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.060
It's so freaking boring.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.920
All we do we sit around and drink beer.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.260
Are you kidding?  This is my dream job!

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.300
Hey!  We're not supposed to be just
sitting around drinking beer.

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:56.460
Remember what Vagan said?  He said we got to move all those crates by morning.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.140
If the cops find this stuff, we are screwed.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.300
Where are we supposed to move them?

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.740
I don't know.  I didn't really listen to
that part.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.560
Hey, give me another beer.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.480
Oh here, have mine.  I shouldn't drink anymore.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.040
*sniff*

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.760
*cough*

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.160
I have a really bad cold.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.120
All right!

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.460
Wait... is this a low carb beer?

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.400
Hey, speaking of beer...

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.340
Did you beans hear what happened at the party last night?

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.940
Some dude went in there, and killed everyone.

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.300
He even killed Cappuccino's nephew.

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.560
Geez...

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.000
Who was this bean that killed everyone?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.060
Is he someone I should be worried about?

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:41.500
Nah.  He's probably just some crazed lunatic, running around with lots of guns.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.680
You know, that's the problem with this country.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.260
Too many crazed lunatics with guns.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.640
Isn't that right, baby?

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.740
The lunatics aren't the problem.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:53.540
The real problem is the guns.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.780
What this country needs is some serious gun control.

00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:01.760
I mean, we need to take away all
the guns.  All of them!  And just get rid of them!

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.820
But not my gun.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:24.780
Ohhh!

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.340
Ow!

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.300
Bean, you dropped into the wrong place.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.700
Looks like what we got here is a standoff.

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.040
Not really.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.700
Over there!

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.040
Take cover!

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.820
Call the boss!  Get some help!

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:31.960
Hello.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.960
Vagan!  We're being attacked.  I think it's Killer Bean!

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.820
How do you know?

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:38.960
Well...

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.720
He's killing everyone!

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:48.160
We're sending the mercenaries.  Just hold tight.

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.000
Keep firing!  Don't let up!

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.320
Grenade!!

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:59.240
I can see we came to the right place.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.560
You made short work of these beans.

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.100
Don't expect the same fight from us.

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:10.740
My squad has been with me through hell.

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:15.160
I hand selected them myself from the Academy ten years ago.

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.180
All of them graduated with top honors.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:21.380
I led these beans through three tours of duty,

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:26.640
accumulating a total of 15 Medals of Honor, 11 Purple Hearts.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.380
Sure, we lost a few good beans...

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:34.580
But you should see what we did to the other bloke.

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:48.160
Well, then we went into business for ourselves.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.880
Escort detail for high-level dignitaries,

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.960
Hostage extraction, corporate assassinations, preemptive surgical strikes,

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.860
Or just plain search and destroy.

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:05.040
Heck, we even robbed a few federal banks with business with slow.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.500
So...

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:09.680
So this little shindig we got here...

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.000
Oh, it's nothing.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.620
It's just a walk in the park.

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.520
Are you going to say something or what?

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.520
Huh?

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.540
Oh, I'm sorry.  I must have totally zoned out on you.

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:31.740
Whoa, my eyes are starting to water.  Whoo!

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.840
Sorry.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:42.580
Let's make one thing clear.  Last night
was a party.

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.460
Tonight, I get to work!

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:28.800
Decaffeinated.

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.720
Oh well.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.340
It was worth a try.

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:40.220
This is not a good idea.  We should kill him now.

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.160
Patience, Vagan.

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.960
I need answers.

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:47.260
I need answers from him.

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.520
He's awake.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.880
So.

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:09.600
This is the great Killer Bean.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.440
Yeah.

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.680
You attack my warehouses.

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.860
You kill my beans.

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.660
What do you want from me?!

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:24.340
My guns would be nice.

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:32.540
Better enjoy a while it lasts, tough guy.

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:36.140
Tough words from a bean who is helpless.

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.040
Ohhh...

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.300
No, you did not!

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.900
Okay.  Maybe you did.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:53.780
What do you want, Killer Bean?  Who are you working for?

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.640
What.  You expect me to just blurt it all out?

00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:01.660
My nephew was at the Baker Street warehouse when you attacked it, okay.

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:05.040
I think you owe me an explanation.

00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.720
Your nephew?

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.840
Hmm... Your nephew...

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.140
He was such a good boy.

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:15.140
He wanted to be a DJ as some big nightclub.

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:19.780
I told him, someday I'll buy you your own my club.

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:22.540
As long as you sell my drugs there.

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:26.080
Eh, the profit sharing we never agreed on.

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:30.780
But you know, he was such a sweet kid.

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.960
Oh yeah.  Yeah remember him.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.900
He was the one playing the music.

00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:40.320
He always loved his music.

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.840
Well, he's dead now.

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:50.560
Kill this bean.  He's wasting my time.

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.740
It's about time.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.560
How does it feel to be killed,

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.540
by your own gun?

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.020
Funny...

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.940
I was about to ask you the same thing.

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:20.240
Are we done playing games for today?

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.620
Finally...

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:32.420
Dispatch.

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:33.980
This is Cromwell.

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.720
Roger, Detective Cromwell.

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:38.940
I need backup.  I'm at 43rd and Main Street.

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:40.380
Right away, sir.

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:42.000
There's no rush.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.020
I got time.

00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:46.260
Cromwell out.

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:55.020
How dare you!

00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:59.460
How dare you come onto my property, looking to kill me!

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:02.040
Who do you think you are?

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.540
Hate to burst your bubble, Cappuccino...

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:06.980
but I'm not here to kill you.

00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:08.400
What?

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:11.700
I'm here to kill him.

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:15.440
You just got in my way.

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:17.520
I don't understand.

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.220
You want to kill him?

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:20.780
Not me?

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:22.960
What the hell is going on?

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.120
Just shoot him already.

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.160
It's complicated.

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:29.360
Why don't you just beat it.

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:33.780
No.  I'm quite interested to knowing why.

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:36.380
Fine.  You wanna die to?

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:39.800
Believe me, it's no trouble at all.

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.640
Actually, uh...

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.720
I think that my estimated taxes are due soon.

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:49.560
I like to stay on top of that stuff.

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.580
Good idea.

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:53.440
Oh.

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.520
By the way.

00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.060
Vagan?

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.780
You're fired!!

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:16.800
It's about time they sent someone with
some talent after me.

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:20.460
Nothing but the best for you, Dark Bean.

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:25.320
Yeah.  I guess they finally learned it's gonna take the best.

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:28.200
What the hell is going on?

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:33.920
You were one of the Shadow Agency's top beans.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:35.720
I used to look up to you.

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:37.780
Now I have to kill you.

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.120
Why did you betray us, Dark Bean?

00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:42.440
I didn't betray anyone.

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:45.100
The Shadow Agency betrayed me.

00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:46.360
What?

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:52.120
You're the one who destroyed our database, and stole years of intelligence work.  How could you do that?

00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:58.500
And how could you go from policing the world to running guns for this two-bit gangster?

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:02.320
Why did you join the Shadow Agency, Killer Bean?

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:07.840
To get rid of the trash in this world, one bullet at a time.

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:12.260
Yeah, we all joined for the same reason.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:15.800
But when I joined the Shadow Agency 12 years ago,

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.960
It was more clear cut.

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:23.560
Our job was to neutralize threats, while the politicians were paralyzed in diplomatic bullshit.

00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:26.220
That's just the way I like it.

00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:28.200
Times have changed.

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:30.820
The agency was always privately controlled,

00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:34.980
But originally we always worked with the government to protect our citizens.

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:37.140
Then it all changed.

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:40.280
I'm not sure what caused the shift but now,

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:44.800
we're just guns for hire, providing services to the highest bidder.

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:49.240
Anyone with the right amount of money can buy the talents of the Shadow Beans.

00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:52.560
On one mission, I was asked to protect some rich dictator.

00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:56.180
On another, I assassinated an opposing leader.

00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:58.040
It didn't matter what we did.

00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:03.060
The Shadow Agency always convinced us that what we did was for the right reasons.

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:10.700
But before I left, they had me deliver weapons to the very group of beans I had spent several years trying to take down.

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:13.100
That was it for me.

00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.740
Do you expect me to believe any of this?

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:22.300
All I know is that you breached the agency's security, and stole years of intelligence work.

00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:24.340
I didn't steal anything.

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:26.900
All the information I took was mine.

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:33.180
I wasn't about to give up 12 years of sweat and blood.  I needed it to continue my work.

00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:38.080
And exactly how does serving Cappuccino continue your work?

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:41.620
Cappuccino is a major player in the weapons market.

00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:44.680
Posing as his lackey puts me on the inside.

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:50.560
I can find out who wants what, who sells
what, and where the big threats are.

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:58.920
But unlike at the Shadow Agency, I can finally kill the beans who deserve to be killed.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:05.300
You got yourself a few more minutes of
life with that story, Dark Bean.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.620
But you can't out talk my trigger finger.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:11.160
It doesn't matter if you believe me or not.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.160
This is probably your last mission.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:17.000
If I don't kill you, the Shadow Agency will.

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:22.620
What the hell are you talking about?  I'm
one of their best Shadow Beans.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.760
Why would they want me dead?

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.500
The Shadow Agency knows I could expose them.

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:31.160
Any agent that comes in contact with me is compromised.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.880
And from what I've been hearing,

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.980
You've been a liability to the agency since the day you started.

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:42.680
Seeing the mess you made last night confirms that the Shadow Agency has a hard time controlling you.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:46.040
They must know you joined for the same
reasons I did.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:50.340
They know it's only a matter of time
before you find out the truth about them.

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:55.440
And if they can't control you now, how
will they control you when you do find out?

01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:01.520
It's smarter for them to diffuse you
now, before you become a bigger problem.

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:06.440
If they wanted me dead, then why even
send me on this mission?

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:10.380
You said it yourself.  You're one of their best.

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:14.900
They tried to kill me before.  They sent Shadow Beans after me twice.

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:17.420
They both failed.

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:20.040
Think about it, Killer Bean.

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:24.660
They want us both dead, and we're hard to kill.

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:29.800
Regardless of the outcome of this mission, the agency gets what they want.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.540
Because one of us will be eliminated.

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:37.520
No, no.  You're lying.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:41.580
I'm not gonna believe you.  I won't believe a word you say.

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:30.940
I had to take the shot.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:35.420
I would have done more with my life than you ever will.

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:37.940
Doesn't matter now.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:42.060
We're both dead beans.

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.080
Dispatch.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.500
This is Cromwell.  Where's my backup?

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:13.660
6 squad cars eta 3 minutes, 2 special assault units in 5.

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.100
Get me more.

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.280
How many, sir?

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.200
Everyone.

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:40.180
Yes?

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:50.260
Yes, I am here.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:01.800
'Deactivated'

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.960
And who is the target?

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.760
'Deactivated'

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:30.280
No.  No problem at all.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.200
I've always wanted to meet him.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:37.140
I'll call you when the job is done.

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:38.360
'Secure Connection'

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.060
Drop your guns!

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:12.820
Put em down, now!

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.680
It's not gonna end like this.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.720
Drop your guns!

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.520
Whoa, whoa ,whoa!  Easy, hold your fire!

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:36.060
Finally brought some backup, huh.

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:39.560
Yeah.  Does this satisfy your ego?

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:43.660
What do you want, Cromwell?  Coming to see if I did your dirty work?

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:46.240
He's right over there.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.080
Yeah, he's dead all right.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.860
But you didn't kill him.

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:51.580
He did.

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.180
What does it matter?

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:58.760
You got the results you wanted.  Now just step aside and let me by.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.540
Let you by?

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:02.660
You're the key to this whole mess.

01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:08.540
If I let you go, I'll never find out about the Shadow Agency, or the Shadow Beans.

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:10.540
I can't help you.

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:11.780
Why not?

01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:14.900
You are Shadow Bean, aren't you?

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.600
Not anymore.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.900
They're coming after you, aren't they.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.740
Don't shoot!  Hold your fire!

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:40.220
If you tell me what I need to know, I can protect you.

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:43.120
I highly doubt that.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.880
I can at least give you a place to stay tonight.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.280
Let me help you, Killer Bean.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:11.000
There is nothing you can do that will help me.

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:54.239
But I do need a quiet place to think.

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:25.059
Not exactly what I had in mind, but this will do.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:28.939
Make yourself at home.  This will keep you safe for the night.

01:09:28.939 --> 01:09:32.259
Hell, it'll probably keep us safe too.

01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:35.140
I don't plan on staying long.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:41.019
I'll be back in the morning.  We have a
lot to talk about.

01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:03.560
Who were these guys?  I'd like to know where they get guns like this.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:08.300
Hey, don't touch that stuff.  You know better than that.  You're contaminating the evidence.

01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:12.260
I don't think we're going to have a shortage of evidence here.

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:34.580
Whoa, hold it!  This is a crime scene.  No
one is allowed on the premises.

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:38.560
Yeah.  Nobody ordered no egg foo yung here.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.580
Where is Killer Bean?

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:45.680
Killer Bean?  We put his ass in the slammer.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.380
Wait.

01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:49.960
Who are you?

01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:59.800
Let me put it in a language you can understand.

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:04.660
So sorry.  No chow mein here.  You deliver wrong place.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.940
Get your hands in the air!  Put them up, now!

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:27.260
Now put your hands on your head, drop to
your knees.

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:21.120
Commander.  Thanks for your help.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.160
I'm turning in for the night.  I'll be back in the morning.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.060
Right, sir.  We'll be here when you get back.

01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:28.640
Excellent.

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.180
What do we got here?

01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:47.340
Just some punk bean
we caught assaulting an officer.

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:50.460
Well he sure picked the wrong night to do that.

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.300
Take him in.

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:33.020
Hold it!  Another move, and we drop you!

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.920
Take him out!

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:24.060
These are very nice guns.

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:46.420
Are you sure you want to do that?

01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:50.240
You need them more than I do.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:58.900
So you're the bean they sent to kill me.

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.820
Mmm hmm.

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.500
Who are you?

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:09.540
I am Jet Bean.
Assassin from the East.

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:14.820
I completed my mission.  Why do they want me dead?

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:17.800
They don't tell me why.

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:20.500
And I don't ask.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:25.220
They decided to kill me the moment they sent
me on this mission, didn't they.

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:27.520
That's what Dark Bean told me.

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:32.280
The agency knew that once I found out the truth about them, they couldn't trust me.

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.500
They were right.

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:38.240
Save your breath, Killer Bean.

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:40.660
You're going to need it.

01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:46.560
Don't you know what the Shadow Agency is?  Don't you realize how they're using us?

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:50.460
I can see you've been brainwashed by Dark Bean.

01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:52.720
He was a fool.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:57.700
No one Shadow Bean can threaten the agency.

01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:02.140
But I'm no Shadow Bean.

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:20.080
I certainly hope you trained harder than that.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.240
Well...

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.420
At least you're in the fighting mood now.

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:15.760
You have been a formidable opponent.

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:20.340
I am sorry I have to end this game.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:31.620
You already tried that.

01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:10.200
It's over.

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:18.480
Not for you.

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.820
'Secure Connection'

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:16.600
Jet Bean, is your mission complete?

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:19.300
Jet Bean is dead.

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:22.100
Killer Bean...

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:26.520
I learned a lot about the Shadow Agency today.

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.760
And it's not for me.

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.460
I quit.

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:35.580
Don't be rash.  Think about what
you are doing.

01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:39.200
Why don't you come in?  We can talk
things over.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:44.200
Oh, I'm coming in.  But it won't be for talking.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.560
This will do.
