00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:03.832
Alpa chino!

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:07.069
We're loaded I love
the pussy, hell, yeah

00:00:07.172 --> 00:00:08.571
I love the pussy, hell, yeah

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:11.336
I love that pussy
dripping down to the floor, oh, no

00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:13.934
the wettest pussy, hell, yeah
I love the pussy, hell, yeah

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:17.140
I'm drinking up
your Booty sweat and busting a nut

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.012
alpa chino got that pussy control

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:21.018
alpa chino's Booty sweat.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.553
Pop an ass open!

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:26.147
Booty sweat and bust-a-nut bars
available at concessions now.

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:34.392
In 2013, when the earth's rotation
came to a halt...

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.061
The president has declared
all of north America a disaster area.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.866
I call on my fellow Americans
to come together...

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:45.000
The world called on the one man
who could make a difference.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:53.075
When it happened again,
the world called on him once more.

00:00:54.486 --> 00:01:00.356
And no one saw it coming
three more times!

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:04.556
Now,

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:08.599
the one man who made a difference
five times before,

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:15.405
is about to make a difference again.

00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:20.237
Only this time, it's different.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.708
Who left the fridge open?

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.084
Tugg speedman.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:31.953
Scorcher vl: Global meltdown.

00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:33.820
Here we go again.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:36.361
Again.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.837
Will there be anything else?

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.137
Yes, my dear man. More beans.

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:55.106
Granny!

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.209
Please!

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:03.277
This summer,
America's favorite obese family is back.

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:07.716
Gross!

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:09.851
- You're just mad 'cause I'm skinny.
- Am not!

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.919
Jeff portnoy.

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:14.065
Jeff portnoy.

00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:16.156
Jeff portnoy.

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:22.366
And Jeff portnoy are
the fatties: Fart two.

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.305
In some countries,

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:27.138
it's considered a compliment.

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:30.443
Letting loose this summer.

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:45.459
In a time where to be different
was to be condemned,

00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:03.910
and to be condemned was to die,

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:12.214
one man chose to question his God.

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:17.890
From fox searchlight,

00:03:26.738 --> 00:03:29.969
five-time academy award winner
kirk Lazarus

00:03:31.076 --> 00:03:35.410
and mtv movie award
best kiss winner tobey Maguire.

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:46.315
Winner of the Beijing film festival's
coveted crying monkey award,

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:49.517
Satan's alley.

00:03:54.032 --> 00:03:56.557
I've been a bad, bad boy, father.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.868
In the winter of 1969,

00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:36.998
an elite force of the U.S. army

00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:41.978
was sent on a top-secret assignment
in southeast Vietnam.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.844
The objective,
rescue sergeant four leaf tayback

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.010
from a heavily guarded
nva prison camp.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.214
The mission was considered
to be near suicide.

00:04:52.524 --> 00:04:55.823
Of the 10 men sent, four returned.

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:59.364
Of those four, three wrote books
about what happened.

00:04:59.464 --> 00:05:02.433
Of those three, two were published.

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:06.698
Of those two, just one got a movie deal.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:13.440
This is the story of the men
who attempted to make that movie.

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:26.850
Whiskey fire old snake
requests an lz prep

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:29.519
at Alpha-delta-two-four-eight-niner,
over.

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:39.099
Floyd, this is lead. Right Echelon
approach from rp to lz, acknowledge.

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:42.002
Floyd, wall-eye airborne.
Welcome aboard.

00:05:45.844 --> 00:05:47.573
All right, lead's going in.
Give her some cover.

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:50.512
Delivery on five.
I repeat, delivery on five.

00:05:56.588 --> 00:05:58.886
This is zero-three.
I'm on your six, don't worry.

00:05:59.224 --> 00:06:01.852
Chalk-three's taking fire.
Guns right, guns right.

00:06:13.905 --> 00:06:16.032
Lay that shit down!

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:17.438
Come on!

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:21.576
Come on, you damn dirty heathens!

00:06:23.515 --> 00:06:25.710
Fats! Run your motherfucking ass

00:06:25.817 --> 00:06:27.114
hold these men off, now!

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:28.914
We're fixing to lift off!

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:31.649
Put some pep in your step, dick!
Jelly-ass bitch!

00:06:31.757 --> 00:06:35.056
Wall-eye, wall-eye,
this is boomer one-seven in the zee!

00:06:35.894 --> 00:06:39.295
I need fast movers

00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:41.764
Boomer, this is wall-eye.

- Oh, Jesus! Holy shit!

00:06:44.202 --> 00:06:45.362
Holy shit!

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.267
Get on that horn
and get some firepower, boy!

00:06:47.372 --> 00:06:48.372
Jesus Christ!

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.532
Listen, you cherry fuck,

00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:53.133
you call in that snake and nape
and get us some boom-boom now!

00:06:53.245 --> 00:06:55.713
I'd do it myself
but I'm kind of goddamn busy!

00:06:55.814 --> 00:06:57.179
I need an answer, boomer!

00:06:57.282 --> 00:06:58.977
Wall-eye, wall-eye!

00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:00.783
I copy!

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:03.317
We got beaucoup zips in the zee.

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:04.912
Rock and roll!

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.780
What the fuck?

00:07:18.737 --> 00:07:21.171
That's for Brooklyn, motherfucker!

00:07:21.273 --> 00:07:23.207
I think I can put it back in!

00:07:23.308 --> 00:07:25.071
We got to get back to the bird.

00:07:25.177 --> 00:07:26.269
Lukemeyer's got popped!

00:07:26.378 --> 00:07:29.313
This is the last Christmas
I spend with Victor Charlie up my ass!

00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:32.177
Want some? Get some!

00:07:32.617 --> 00:07:35.450
Hey, yo, fats! I ain't seen four leaf!

00:07:35.554 --> 00:07:38.750
Don't count him out! That bastard's
got luck tattooed to his ass!

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.882
Motown, get your Detroit jukebox
jheri curl ass

00:07:41.993 --> 00:07:44.223
in this chickenshit chop-chop! Asafp!

00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:46.209
Four leaf is still
outside the perimeter, sarge!

00:07:46.264 --> 00:07:49.290
Miss me with that cracker chump jive!
We di di mau! We di di mau!

00:07:49.434 --> 00:07:51.061
Come on, sarge. Stop jiving.
Four leaf is there.

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:52.864
Dead meat, soldier!

00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:54.971
Or do you want to be a hero?

00:07:55.073 --> 00:07:57.073
That's just how Brooks
got his Jew ass killed, man.

00:07:57.075 --> 00:07:59.771
And meatball's dago ass
bought the six-by-three farm.

00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:03.575
Now get your ass up in the huey, before
I stomp a trench in your hiney hole!

00:08:05.183 --> 00:08:06.582
Come on, get down, get down!

00:08:06.685 --> 00:08:08.710
What am I looking at? What is this?

00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:13.580
Come on, let's get, let's go!
Come on, elevator up, up!

00:08:13.692 --> 00:08:16.217
Sarge. It's four leaf.

00:08:28.507 --> 00:08:29.565
No!

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.434
You get out of that hole!

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.355
You make it home, now.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.062
Survive!

00:09:10.849 --> 00:09:12.874
I hope y'all like hamburger meat.

00:09:12.984 --> 00:09:15.064
'Cause that's exactly what
I'm gonna be bringing back

00:09:15.153 --> 00:09:17.178
and serving up in this whirly bird.

00:09:17.289 --> 00:09:19.780
Cover me, you limp dick fuckups!

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.661
Peek-a-boo! I see you!

00:09:30.702 --> 00:09:32.431
Hold on, four leaf!

00:09:35.073 --> 00:09:36.404
Oh, shit!

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:45.706
Watch my right!

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:50.455
Fuck you, Charlie!

00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:57.691
Come on, leaf, let's boogie!

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.730
No!

00:10:10.909 --> 00:10:13.002
- Fats!
- Holy fuck!

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:16.839
Take us over to those men! Shit!

00:10:21.319 --> 00:10:24.288
Look at you, man.
Playing with grenades.

00:10:27.792 --> 00:10:29.054
I'm cold, Linc.

00:10:31.096 --> 00:10:32.927
I can't feel my legs.

00:10:34.065 --> 00:10:36.056
Ain't nothing but a thang.

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:40.969
Hey, Linc.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.305
What, man?

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:46.636
Why does man

00:10:46.745 --> 00:10:49.680
got to pick up sticks
against another man?

00:10:51.883 --> 00:10:54.181
Instead of using them sticks to

00:10:55.554 --> 00:10:57.146
prop a man up?

00:10:57.255 --> 00:10:58.882
I'll never know.

00:11:00.191 --> 00:11:04.358
Hold my hands, 'cause
I got something to...

00:11:04.462 --> 00:11:06.327
I got something to say.

00:11:07.732 --> 00:11:09.393
Oh, boy.

00:11:13.538 --> 00:11:16.234
- You holding 'em?
- I got 'em tight.

00:11:18.977 --> 00:11:20.638
When we get back to the world,

00:11:21.112 --> 00:11:25.276
we gonna put together that three-piece
combo band we talked about?

00:11:25.383 --> 00:11:28.375
- Me on stand-up bass.
- Johnny on drums.

00:11:29.854 --> 00:11:31.981
And me tickling the ivories.

00:11:34.092 --> 00:11:37.357
I ain't never been worth a nothing
in this life,

00:11:37.462 --> 00:11:40.226
but I want you to know something.

00:11:41.299 --> 00:11:42.596
What, man?

00:11:44.502 --> 00:11:45.799
You are my...

00:11:47.305 --> 00:11:49.000
You are my brother.

00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:07.015
You are my brother.
You are my... you are my...

00:12:07.192 --> 00:12:08.819
I am your brother.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.059
I'm sorry. Could we cut?

00:12:14.165 --> 00:12:15.766
- What's he saying?
- Damien, can we cut?

00:12:15.767 --> 00:12:17.428
- No. No, no, no, no, no...
- All right, you know what?

00:12:17.535 --> 00:12:20.527
We got the jets coming in,
big explosion, two minutes.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.731
Still rolling.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.467
You know what? No, not still rolling.
Can we cut?

00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:25.236
- We're cutting.
- No, we're not. Get out!

00:12:25.343 --> 00:12:27.343
Hey, what's going on?
For real, my butt is hurting!

00:12:27.412 --> 00:12:29.539
This harness is riding up my crack!

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:32.116
- Damien, are we cutting?
- No! No! Still rolling!

00:12:32.217 --> 00:12:34.344
Mr. cockburn! Are we cutting, sir?

00:12:34.452 --> 00:12:37.615
No! No. I'm not cutting!
We're still rolling!

00:12:37.722 --> 00:12:38.780
Damien, what's the dealy, dude?

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.687
Are we gonna blow
this tree line or what?

00:12:40.792 --> 00:12:42.353
Tuk tuk and Kim
got the blue balls here.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.688
I'm gonna let them squirt if we're a go!

00:12:43.795 --> 00:12:46.115
- Play it through. Still rolling!
- Dieter, can he hear me?

00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:48.691
That's c-4, dipshit. Put that back.
I said a detonator.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.166
I need some dudes up here
who speak American, God damn it!

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:52.830
He's making
a fucking sweater back here.

00:12:52.837 --> 00:12:55.169
I'm trying to put tiger balm
on this jungle's nuts.

00:12:55.273 --> 00:12:56.433
Everyone, please shut up.

00:12:56.541 --> 00:12:58.742
The jets are coming in.
We only have one chance at this!

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.209
And go!

00:13:00.311 --> 00:13:02.609
Let's do it. You feel it?
You feel me?

00:13:03.615 --> 00:13:05.981
- You are my...
- I am your brother.

00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:08.316
We've seen it all, man.

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:10.054
I'm sorry, Damien?

00:13:10.155 --> 00:13:11.452
Are you seeing that?

00:13:11.556 --> 00:13:13.956
The little froggy on the boom Mike?
It's right in my eyeline.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.555
Donny! What's up, man?

00:13:18.229 --> 00:13:19.196
It's been there the whole show.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.354
Yeah, well it's right in my face,

00:13:20.465 --> 00:13:21.454
I'm staring at a frog,
I'm trying to feel...

00:13:21.566 --> 00:13:24.126
It's always the yellow frog that
brings them black frog on Fridays, man.

00:13:24.235 --> 00:13:25.930
Hell, no, I didn't pee on that girl.

00:13:26.037 --> 00:13:28.130
No, I didn't pee on her,
listen, listen, listen, listen. No, no.

00:13:28.239 --> 00:13:30.764
The story is this. She was in the way
when I was peeing, she walked past.

00:13:30.875 --> 00:13:33.241
What the fuck is going on here?

00:13:33.344 --> 00:13:35.505
On three, baby. One, two, breathe.

00:13:35.613 --> 00:13:38.138
Look, do me a favor. I don't want to do
a countdown before I do the scene.

00:13:38.249 --> 00:13:39.307
- No countdown?
- No countdown.

00:13:39.417 --> 00:13:40.611
- Okay.
- Can we just do it off of "action"?

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:42.277
Just... in your own time.

00:13:42.387 --> 00:13:44.184
- Good...
- I'm not a rocket ship, okay?

00:13:44.289 --> 00:13:45.916
- All right, dude.
- And action!

00:13:46.024 --> 00:13:48.959
Whatever floats your boat, baby.
Fuck! Don't die!

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.494
Erika, get me a vitaminwater!

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:53.157
You know what it is, Damien? I'm sorry.

00:13:53.164 --> 00:13:57.567
Not to get into his thing, but if
I'm crying, should osiris be crying, too?

00:13:57.669 --> 00:13:59.569
- No, it's everyone cry...
- We cutting or we crying?

00:13:59.671 --> 00:14:01.002
- No, no, no, we're crying!
- Just call it, man!

00:14:01.106 --> 00:14:03.233
- Kirk, you can cry. Tugg, you can cry.
- Thanks!

00:14:03.341 --> 00:14:05.070
- Everybody cry...
- You know what?

00:14:05.176 --> 00:14:07.144
- You see how agitated he is now?
- I know.

00:14:07.245 --> 00:14:09.725
- Let's make lemonade. Let's go to work.
- Okay. Still rolling!

00:14:10.081 --> 00:14:12.743
This is falcon one. We have the Ridge
in sight, approximately two Miles out.

00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:15.115
Dieter, these jets
are about to crest this Ridge line.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.154
They got about 200 pounds
of shit your pants.

00:14:17.255 --> 00:14:18.695
I need to know if we're ready to go.

00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:23.357
- You're my... you're my...
- I am your...

00:14:23.461 --> 00:14:26.919
See, that's what I think it is, Damien.
I think it's the line.

00:14:27.031 --> 00:14:28.055
Yeah?

00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:30.031
I don't know if four leaf
would say that... four leaf?

00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:32.467
Were you crying
when your hands blew up?

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.197
No. See, he didn't.
Yeah, I mean, just that's what...

00:14:34.305 --> 00:14:35.863
So now we in re-writes, right?

00:14:35.974 --> 00:14:37.100
- Where you going?
- Let's re-write it!

00:14:37.208 --> 00:14:39.369
Action Jackson can't cry.
That's what's going down.

00:14:39.477 --> 00:14:41.445
You know what, kirk?
I'm ready to do the scene!

00:14:41.546 --> 00:14:45.107
What scene? The scene is
about emotionality. Where is it?

00:14:45.216 --> 00:14:46.808
- Now it's time to flip the script!
- Kirk...

00:14:46.918 --> 00:14:49.119
Be here till Chinese new year
waiting for my man to cry.

00:14:49.287 --> 00:14:51.255
You're tangling me,
you're fucking tangling me.

00:14:51.356 --> 00:14:52.636
You're tangling me, God damn it!

00:14:52.657 --> 00:14:55.490
- Kirk, no!
- Stop tailgating me, you pasty tea bag!

00:14:55.593 --> 00:14:57.390
I'm going potty.
You want to hold my dick?

00:14:57.862 --> 00:15:00.626
Shit! What are you fucking both doing,
good lord!

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:03.324
We're getting this in a wide shot, right?

00:15:03.434 --> 00:15:04.958
Of course we're getting it
in a fucking wide.

00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:06.093
What, do you think
I'm a dick or something?

00:15:06.204 --> 00:15:09.339
Get that fucking food...
Here they come!

00:15:10.441 --> 00:15:12.841
- The planes are inbound!
- Shit! Shit!

00:15:12.944 --> 00:15:17.847
Shit, shit, cocksucker, bollocks.
Tropic tits!

00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:20.918
That's the signal! Go, go, go, go, go!

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:23.078
Let's go freaking tet here!

00:15:23.188 --> 00:15:25.179
Goddamn shit-picking cock!

00:15:27.292 --> 00:15:28.884
That's my shit!

00:15:34.432 --> 00:15:37.367
Mother nature just pissed her pantsuit!

00:15:45.243 --> 00:15:46.471
- Sweet.
- Oh, mama!

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.544
Bungle in the jungle.

00:15:51.649 --> 00:15:54.743
More bad news from the vietnamese set
of tropic thunder,

00:15:54.853 --> 00:15:58.584
where a $4 million explosion
charred the Asian location

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.658
and the camera wasn't even rolling.

00:16:00.758 --> 00:16:03.420
Financed by hotheaded mega-mogul
les Grossman,

00:16:03.528 --> 00:16:06.622
the film is already rumored to be
one month behind schedule

00:16:06.731 --> 00:16:09.598
just five days into shooting.
The reason?

00:16:09.701 --> 00:16:12.636
Fingers are pointed at rookie director
Damien cockburn,

00:16:12.737 --> 00:16:15.831
who, insiders say,
can't control a star-studded cast,

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.639
including flatulent star of the popular
fatties franchise, Jeff portnoy.

00:16:20.745 --> 00:16:23.270
Let me tell you something.
A lot of people are disrespecting me.

00:16:23.381 --> 00:16:27.112
They say that the movie's
just about farts. It's about family,

00:16:27.218 --> 00:16:30.312
and... you! You can't do what I do.

00:16:30.421 --> 00:16:34.653
Fresh from his most recent arrest
for heroin, glue and crack possession,

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:37.125
portnoy was almost uninsurable.

00:16:37.228 --> 00:16:41.562
Also in the mix is Booty sweat-hocking
hip-hop hyphenate alpa chino.

00:16:41.666 --> 00:16:44.157
I'm so excited, you know what I'm
saying, about doing tropic thunder.

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:46.430
Hey, drink Booty sweat, baby.
Drink Booty sweat.

00:16:46.537 --> 00:16:48.198
But the real heavyweight on the set

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.217
is five-time academy award winner
kirk Lazarus.

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:51.082
Is five-time academy award winner
kirk Lazarus.

00:16:51.109 --> 00:16:54.840
The brilliant Australian
known for his bad boy antics off-screen

00:16:54.946 --> 00:16:58.541
is famous for his total immersion
into any role he portrays.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.947
Well, being an actor is no different

00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:02.246
than being a rugby player
or a construction worker,

00:17:02.353 --> 00:17:03.479
save for the fact that my tools

00:17:03.588 --> 00:17:05.647
are the mechanisms
that trigger human emotion.

00:17:05.757 --> 00:17:07.816
Lazarus underwent a controversial

00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:10.918
pigmentation alteration procedure
in order to play

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:14.123
the platoon's African-American
sergeant, Lincoln osiris.

00:17:14.232 --> 00:17:15.665
Yeah!

00:17:15.767 --> 00:17:17.632
Trying to hold his own onscreen
with kirk

00:17:17.735 --> 00:17:19.862
is action juggernaut tugg speedman.

00:17:19.971 --> 00:17:22.769
Once the highest grossing star
in the world,

00:17:22.874 --> 00:17:25.934
lately his scorcher films
have lost their heat.

00:17:26.044 --> 00:17:28.638
Recently, speedman opened up to Tyra.

00:17:28.746 --> 00:17:30.680
You have no real family.

00:17:30.782 --> 00:17:35.219
You're on the wrong side of 40.
You're childless and alone.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.015
Somebody close to you said,

00:17:37.121 --> 00:17:39.919
"one more flop and it's over."

00:17:42.026 --> 00:17:44.119
Somebody said they were close to me?

00:17:45.063 --> 00:17:46.189
It's been a tough year for tugg.

00:17:46.297 --> 00:17:49.061
The disappointing buddy comedy
chitlin' & the dude

00:17:49.167 --> 00:17:53.831
was followed by an ill-advised venture
into serious dramatic territory.

00:17:53.938 --> 00:17:55.030
Simple Jack,

00:17:55.139 --> 00:17:58.870
the story of a mentally impaired
farmhand who can talk to animals,

00:17:58.977 --> 00:18:00.842
was a box office disaster

00:18:00.945 --> 00:18:05.541
that many critics called,
"one of the worst movies of all time."

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:09.279
I ain't got a good brain.

00:18:10.288 --> 00:18:13.189
I think you've got a fine brain, Jack.

00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:18.456
You make me happy.

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:24.435
But now the question is,
can speedman make audiences happy

00:18:24.535 --> 00:18:26.298
in what's being called
the most expensive

00:18:26.404 --> 00:18:28.668
- war movie never made?
- Rick peck.

00:18:28.773 --> 00:18:30.293
Wishing tugg all the best on that one.

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:34.709
Rum-tum-tuggernauts, it's the pecker.
You got time for your agent?

00:18:34.812 --> 00:18:36.074
- Rick?
- Hey, buddy,

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.738
guess who I'm staring at right now.

00:18:37.849 --> 00:18:39.510
- What?
- I'm looking at your ugly mug

00:18:39.617 --> 00:18:41.915
on the back cover
of vanity fair magazine,

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.454
holding a cute, cuddly panda
from cutesville.

00:18:44.555 --> 00:18:47.149
It is insane, bro. You are a rock star.

00:18:47.258 --> 00:18:49.852
Hey, did you get the gift basket I sent?

00:18:49.961 --> 00:18:50.985
From Rick.

00:18:51.095 --> 00:18:53.188
Yeah. Yeah. It's cool, man. Thanks.

00:18:53.297 --> 00:18:55.857
All right,
that is a real satellite phone, bro.

00:18:55.967 --> 00:18:57.559
Do not re-gift.

00:18:57.668 --> 00:19:00.159
Hey. You see
that access Hollywood piece?

00:19:00.271 --> 00:19:03.206
Yeah, I did.
It was like pistol-whipping a blind kid.

00:19:03.307 --> 00:19:07.744
I mean, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
tugg. You are a huge star, all right?

00:19:07.845 --> 00:19:09.312
But right now,

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:10.972
you're like that kid on the playground,
you know,

00:19:11.082 --> 00:19:14.051
the one who has lice that none
of the other kids want to play with?

00:19:14.152 --> 00:19:16.232
- What do you mean?
- I mean we gotta shave your head

00:19:16.254 --> 00:19:18.722
and get you back
on the monkey bars, right?

00:19:18.823 --> 00:19:20.154
What?

00:19:20.258 --> 00:19:22.123
How did the crying scene go?

00:19:22.226 --> 00:19:23.989
Horrible. Lazarus started crying.

00:19:24.095 --> 00:19:27.258
Then he starts drooling and dribbling,
and it wasn't even in the script...

00:19:27.365 --> 00:19:28.457
Stop right there!

00:19:28.566 --> 00:19:30.295
You gotta buck up here, tuggboat.

00:19:30.401 --> 00:19:33.097
Who cares how much more talented
he may be than you?

00:19:33.204 --> 00:19:36.571
If he cries, you cry harder, man.

00:19:36.674 --> 00:19:38.835
Didn't your dog have, like, leukemia
or something

00:19:38.943 --> 00:19:40.308
when you were a kid?
I mean, think of that.

00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:44.177
Boom! End of story.
They hook up the TiVo yet?

00:19:44.282 --> 00:19:45.544
Good gosh.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.481
- What?
- The TiVo, they hook it up?

00:19:47.585 --> 00:19:49.849
- No. The guy didn't come.
- What?

00:19:49.954 --> 00:19:52.548
For fuck's sake, that is unacceptable.

00:19:52.657 --> 00:19:54.557
They have digital cable, but,
I mean, it's okay.

00:19:54.659 --> 00:19:56.889
No, no, no. Come on, man. It's not okay.

00:19:56.994 --> 00:19:59.121
It is not okay, tugg!

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.358
And you don't need to explain to me
why you need TiVo

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:06.403
or clean water, clean sheets,
food, shelter.

00:20:06.504 --> 00:20:09.598
I mean, I fought for that in your contract.

00:20:09.707 --> 00:20:11.766
How's the adoption thing coming,
buddy?

00:20:11.876 --> 00:20:13.901
Not too great.

00:20:17.148 --> 00:20:19.844
I feel like all the good ones are gone.

00:20:21.519 --> 00:20:23.817
Well, at least you get to choose yours.

00:20:23.921 --> 00:20:25.752
I'm stuck with mine.

00:20:27.658 --> 00:20:30.183
Tell you what, get back to work,
genius soldier.

00:20:30.294 --> 00:20:33.161
The pecker's on a TiVo mission
for the y-o-u.

00:20:33.264 --> 00:20:35.027
Work on those tears, my man.

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:36.225
All right. Yeah.

00:20:36.334 --> 00:20:37.892
Say it for me one time.

00:20:38.002 --> 00:20:42.268
- You make me happy.
- Make me happy.

00:20:42.373 --> 00:20:43.965
- I love you, buddy.
- All right, bye.

00:20:44.876 --> 00:20:46.867
Crisis meeting?
What does that mean, exactly?

00:20:46.978 --> 00:20:48.639
I mean, are we in a crisis?

00:20:48.746 --> 00:20:50.270
He's the head of the studio.

00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:52.747
He's reaching out.
We're 10,000 Miles away.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:53.942
He just wants a little face-time.

00:20:54.051 --> 00:20:56.732
I know, it's just you said
that he called it a crisis meeting. So...

00:20:56.754 --> 00:20:59.154
It's les Grossman.
He throws these words around.

00:20:59.257 --> 00:21:03.660
"Crisis," "explosion,"
"not rolling," "fired."

00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:05.092
These are just words.

00:21:05.196 --> 00:21:07.289
Yeah! Yeah!

00:21:07.398 --> 00:21:10.697
Keep a secret? A camera truck
in London just plowed into judi dench.

00:21:10.801 --> 00:21:11.927
Trust me, he's got bigger problems.

00:21:12.036 --> 00:21:14.504
Look, he may be able to see me,
but I can't see him.

00:21:14.605 --> 00:21:19.133
- Move! Move! Hello, les! Hello!
- Get your ass out of my...

00:21:19.243 --> 00:21:20.676
- Your feet were on my desk.
- Can he see us?

00:21:20.778 --> 00:21:22.109
I don't know why we don't have...

00:21:22.213 --> 00:21:24.374
Get him a diet coke. Les! It's working!

00:21:24.482 --> 00:21:26.973
Yeah, whatever you're doing right there.
Hello, les!

00:21:27.084 --> 00:21:28.483
- Hello, les!
- Okay.

00:21:28.586 --> 00:21:30.645
We got you loud and clear here, les.

00:21:30.755 --> 00:21:34.452
I see you. I see you. I see you.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:37.687
Which one of you fuckfaces
is Damien cockburn?

00:21:38.696 --> 00:21:40.220
That's me, sir.

00:21:40.331 --> 00:21:43.858
It's good to finally meet you at last,
get some face-time.

00:21:43.968 --> 00:21:47.927
And who here is the key grip?
You? You.

00:21:49.941 --> 00:21:53.399
Hit that director in the face,
really fucking hard.

00:22:00.284 --> 00:22:01.615
Sorry, man.

00:22:08.125 --> 00:22:11.026
This is your fault, you limey fuck!

00:22:11.128 --> 00:22:12.993
You shit the money-bed, my friend.

00:22:13.097 --> 00:22:15.622
- What?
- God damn it, Damien!

00:22:15.733 --> 00:22:18.827
With all due respect, les Grossman did
not blow up the jungle.

00:22:18.936 --> 00:22:20.028
- What?
- Fuck the jungle.

00:22:20.137 --> 00:22:21.468
Exactly!

00:22:22.173 --> 00:22:23.640
Come on, man.

00:22:24.375 --> 00:22:27.105
Hey, les, I understand if you're angry,

00:22:27.211 --> 00:22:29.202
but I am dealing
with a bunch of prima Donnas!

00:22:29.313 --> 00:22:32.805
Clowns! Tugg speedman, he can't cry!
He can't cry!

00:22:32.917 --> 00:22:35.317
You know how you handle an actor?
They whine about anything,

00:22:35.419 --> 00:22:38.718
you pull down their pants
and you spank their ass.

00:22:38.823 --> 00:22:41.018
- You spank that ass, les.
- What?

00:22:41.125 --> 00:22:44.891
Spanking a child
turns him into a little snot.

00:22:45.763 --> 00:22:48.664
Fear makes him a man.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:54.296
I know a place
where a man's worth is measured

00:22:54.405 --> 00:22:58.205
in the ears hanging from his dog tags.

00:22:58.309 --> 00:23:01.039
The real deep shit.

00:23:01.145 --> 00:23:03.739
You wanna make this movie right?

00:23:03.848 --> 00:23:07.340
That's where you take
your pansy-ass actors.

00:23:08.919 --> 00:23:10.784
Who is this guy?

00:23:10.888 --> 00:23:12.788
Les, that's four leaf.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:16.189
Sergeant four leaf tayback.
I wrote the book.

00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:22.457
You're a great American.
This nation owes you a huge debt.

00:23:22.566 --> 00:23:25.535
Now shut the fuck up
and let me do my job!

00:23:26.404 --> 00:23:27.871
- Look, cockburn.
- Yes.

00:23:27.972 --> 00:23:31.999
From now on, my fist
is gonna be so far up your shithole

00:23:32.109 --> 00:23:33.509
that every time you have a thought,

00:23:33.577 --> 00:23:36.603
it's gonna have to tiptoe
past my wedding ring.

00:23:36.714 --> 00:23:40.241
Take control of your actors,
or I will shut you down.

00:23:40.351 --> 00:23:41.443
Diet coke!

00:23:59.203 --> 00:24:01.398
One week down, two weeks behind,

00:24:01.505 --> 00:24:05.305
gi Joe can't cry, don't matter 'cause you
ain't got the camera turned on anyway.

00:24:05.409 --> 00:24:06.808
Let's party!

00:24:07.745 --> 00:24:09.645
Man, you better get your shit straight,

00:24:09.747 --> 00:24:12.614
or I'll be on the next netjet out of here,
baby. You feel me?

00:24:13.484 --> 00:24:14.484
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

00:24:14.552 --> 00:24:17.077
Here comes another.
There we go. Now what?

00:24:17.455 --> 00:24:19.787
- Sandusky. Good.
- Hey, Mr. cockburn.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:21.755
We need to have a cast meeting
right now.

00:24:21.859 --> 00:24:23.156
- Right now? Awesome.
- Yes.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.454
You actually care, don't you?

00:24:24.562 --> 00:24:27.156
Yeah, it's a huge deal for me,
are you kidding?

00:24:27.264 --> 00:24:29.232
I've spent the past two years of my life

00:24:29.333 --> 00:24:33.030
living off residuals from a anti-herpes
medication commercial.

00:24:33.137 --> 00:24:34.297
I know, you're the only one
who auditioned,

00:24:34.405 --> 00:24:35.963
the only one who did
the two-week boot camp.

00:24:36.073 --> 00:24:37.734
Hey, hey, alpa.

00:24:38.442 --> 00:24:40.910
I'm the director. He's...
I need to speak to my actor.

00:24:41.011 --> 00:24:42.239
All right, hold up. Chino?

00:24:42.346 --> 00:24:44.109
What? Hell, yo. What's up, baby?

00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:46.539
This about
the Booty sweat cross-promotion?

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:47.674
No, it's about the film.

00:24:47.785 --> 00:24:49.776
Oh, the film and Booty sweat's
the same thing. Give him a shot.

00:24:50.154 --> 00:24:52.281
Hey, how you doing, Jeff?

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.848
- Who are you?
- That's awesome, man.

00:24:58.129 --> 00:25:02.862
Kevin. Kevin sandusky. I play Brooklyn,
we've been working together.

00:25:02.967 --> 00:25:04.559
Oh, right, right. I like you.

00:25:04.668 --> 00:25:06.636
Man, it's a real honor to be here...

00:25:06.737 --> 00:25:08.034
I can tell it's gonna be
a good experience.

00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:09.339
I'm really having a good time.

00:25:09.373 --> 00:25:11.000
Hey, can you help me out, man?
I'm looking for this guy.

00:25:11.108 --> 00:25:15.272
The grip with the bandana.
He's got a package for me.

00:25:15.746 --> 00:25:18.146
There he is, fucker. Dragon!

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.081
What the fuck? Oh, buddy!

00:25:21.218 --> 00:25:22.583
I'm gonna go shoot a video, right?

00:25:22.686 --> 00:25:24.813
I'm gonna have v.C. Soldiers
in the video

00:25:24.922 --> 00:25:26.219
doing the noodle-legs, Damien.

00:25:26.323 --> 00:25:30.692
Hell, yeah, do it. V.C. Soldiers doing
the hip-hop bunny hop, Damien.

00:25:30.928 --> 00:25:32.688
It's good, I love it, great.
But I need to...

00:25:32.696 --> 00:25:35.688
V.C. Soldiers doing the seizure, baby.
Hit it, baby.

00:25:35.833 --> 00:25:37.494
Hell yeah, get it. Get it, cornbread.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.830
Alpa!

00:25:40.938 --> 00:25:42.418
Yo, check it out. Donny on the phone.

00:25:42.473 --> 00:25:43.473
Hello? Yo, yo, Donny!

00:25:43.541 --> 00:25:45.661
Can we call him back?
I've got to have a cast meeting.

00:25:49.146 --> 00:25:51.478
When we put aside our differences,

00:25:51.582 --> 00:25:54.449
we see we're kind of the same.

00:25:55.352 --> 00:25:58.879
When we put aside our differences,
we see

00:26:00.558 --> 00:26:02.423
we're kind of the same.

00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:04.991
Let's be friends.

00:26:05.296 --> 00:26:07.924
I know we can do great things together.

00:26:10.034 --> 00:26:13.800
That's a quotation from
a children's book I co-wrote,

00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:16.699
the boy everybody was jealous of.

00:26:16.807 --> 00:26:18.536
I think it pertains to the journey...

00:26:18.642 --> 00:26:19.973
Simple Jack sucked ass!

00:26:21.045 --> 00:26:23.445
All right, who said that? It's not funny.

00:26:23.547 --> 00:26:25.310
Whoever it is, it's not funny, okay?

00:26:32.623 --> 00:26:35.319
When the herd loses its way,

00:26:35.426 --> 00:26:39.863
the Shepherd must kill
the bull that leads them astray.

00:26:41.699 --> 00:26:44.964
- Four leaf?
- Come on over. It's okay.

00:26:46.637 --> 00:26:48.127
- Sit down.
- Yes.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:54.637
- So, you don't like the hotel?
- Beds give me nightmares.

00:26:59.683 --> 00:27:04.882
I'm guessing right about now
you couldn't find a Dixie coonskin

00:27:04.989 --> 00:27:09.323
with an Ohio hooker holding your prick
and showing you the way.

00:27:16.133 --> 00:27:17.464
What?

00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:19.293
You're a riddle

00:27:20.804 --> 00:27:23.739
with no cheese to maze through.

00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:26.643
Don't you get it?

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:30.441
No, I don't. I'm a cock of the mouse
or something. I don't know.

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:34.484
I put my story in your limp brit hands,

00:27:34.585 --> 00:27:38.021
and you are not going to fail me.

00:27:38.122 --> 00:27:41.717
You think I was just blowing
my own bagpipe in that meeting?

00:27:41.825 --> 00:27:45.659
You must put those boys in the shit.

00:27:45.763 --> 00:27:47.321
What? I don't understand.

00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:50.696
- You wanna make your movie or not?
- Yes, I do.

00:27:50.801 --> 00:27:54.293
All right, you get
some of those little video type cameras.

00:27:54.405 --> 00:27:58.034
We take them out there, and we put
them in the trees in different angles.

00:27:58.142 --> 00:28:01.475
Then you give me
and that pyromaniac Cody

00:28:01.579 --> 00:28:06.448
all the smoke bombs, charges,
explosives, detonators you got.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.984
Then we take those boys up there,

00:28:09.086 --> 00:28:12.180
me and Cody,
we could light up that fucking jungle,

00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:15.224
so those lily-dick actors
would be shitting their pants

00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:17.317
and screaming for their mammies.

00:28:17.428 --> 00:28:20.886
They'd be begging for a body bag
if it means a ride home.

00:28:23.734 --> 00:28:25.258
I could do it.

00:28:26.036 --> 00:28:29.472
I could shoot the whole thing
guerrilla style. Gritty, dirty.

00:28:29.573 --> 00:28:32.906
Get them away from their helpers
and ass-licking assistants.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.102
Put them in the real shit.

00:28:34.211 --> 00:28:35.405
- Real shit.
- With real fear in their eyes!

00:28:35.512 --> 00:28:38.572
Real fear, real emotion!
Yes, four leaf, yes!

00:28:38.682 --> 00:28:40.775
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

00:28:40.884 --> 00:28:42.647
Take them off the fucking grid!

00:29:00.104 --> 00:29:02.868
You are no longer actors in a movie!

00:29:03.974 --> 00:29:06.704
You are five men in a helicopter!

00:29:08.479 --> 00:29:10.242
With three other men!

00:29:15.886 --> 00:29:17.410
How long are we gonna be gone,
anyways?

00:29:17.521 --> 00:29:21.582
'Cause I left most of my vitamins
back at the hotel.

00:29:21.692 --> 00:29:24.252
- Save your breath, maggots!
- That's right, maggots!

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.602
M&M?

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:40.807
M&M?

00:30:00.597 --> 00:30:04.133
Go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!

00:30:04.568 --> 00:30:07.731
Move it, maggots, move!
Move, grunts, move your ass!

00:30:07.838 --> 00:30:10.136
Get out, you wriggly worms!

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.708
- It's up too high!
- Move, move, move!

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.909
See you in hell!

00:30:29.426 --> 00:30:33.624
This is bullshit!
I gotta at least call my fucking assistant.

00:30:34.898 --> 00:30:37.628
Fucking! Jesus! Dude!

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:41.333
You're sitting on a nest
of hostile enemy v.C.

00:30:41.438 --> 00:30:44.874
Congratulations, fats.
You just got us all killed.

00:30:45.876 --> 00:30:49.471
Anybody else care to give away
our position to Charlie?

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.343
Cell phones!

00:30:51.448 --> 00:30:52.915
What the hell, Damien?

00:30:53.016 --> 00:30:56.713
Weren't no cell phones in '69, man.
I'm head-to-toe legitimate.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.221
Gentlemen, I've got good news
and bad news.

00:31:00.324 --> 00:31:03.816
The studio wants to shut us down.
That's the bad news.

00:31:03.961 --> 00:31:06.259
And the good news.

00:31:06.363 --> 00:31:09.264
If you wanna save this movie,
you will become a unit.

00:31:09.366 --> 00:31:13.132
Your objective is to head north
to the d'ang kwook river

00:31:13.237 --> 00:31:14.727
and liberate the pow camp,

00:31:14.838 --> 00:31:18.103
at which point four leaf
will get himself captured,

00:31:18.208 --> 00:31:20.005
at which point you will rescue him,

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.477
at which point
we will chopper you home!

00:31:24.681 --> 00:31:25.773
Damn.

00:31:25.883 --> 00:31:27.680
Four leaf,
since you're the staff sergeant,

00:31:27.785 --> 00:31:30.185
there's the map, this is the scene list.

00:31:30.287 --> 00:31:32.414
Think you can handle it?

00:31:32.523 --> 00:31:36.721
We have rigged this entire
valley of death with hidden cameras.

00:31:38.195 --> 00:31:41.824
And I will be shooting as well,
from unseen vantage points,

00:31:41.932 --> 00:31:45.527
so that every glorious moment
is captured on film.

00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:49.967
And believe me, gentlemen,
it will be glorious.

00:31:50.073 --> 00:31:52.598
If it looks real,
chances are it probably is.

00:31:52.709 --> 00:31:54.301
You wanted to be actors.

00:31:54.411 --> 00:31:57.005
You wanted to occupy
the skin of another human being.

00:31:57.114 --> 00:32:00.106
Well, get ready to occupy the skin
of a terrified U.S. infantry grunt,

00:32:00.217 --> 00:32:03.983
surrounded by death,
crawling up Satan's bottom.

00:32:05.022 --> 00:32:09.721
There'll be ambushes, enemy fire,
your own little personal slice of 'nam.

00:32:09.827 --> 00:32:14.423
This radio goes to the chopper
and the chopper only.

00:32:14.531 --> 00:32:18.968
The chopper is God,
and I am Jesus Christ, his son.

00:32:19.069 --> 00:32:21.765
You are my chosen disciples.

00:32:21.872 --> 00:32:24.898
And no one gets to go home
till we get the shots.

00:32:25.008 --> 00:32:28.034
Put on your war faces, gentlemen.

00:32:28.145 --> 00:32:32.844
Now, let's go and make
the greatest war movie ever!

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:35.282
- Yeah!
- All right!

00:32:54.037 --> 00:32:55.095
Yeah!

00:33:00.544 --> 00:33:01.602
Yeah!

00:33:14.157 --> 00:33:16.057
Not bad, cockburn!

00:33:17.895 --> 00:33:19.089
Not bad.

00:33:20.797 --> 00:33:22.389
Wherever you are!

00:33:24.401 --> 00:33:27.461
Wherever he is?
Looks like he's all over the place.

00:33:29.273 --> 00:33:31.173
Here we go.

00:33:31.275 --> 00:33:33.300
Must be an old French mine.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:36.868
It's a remnant from colonial indo-China.
This jungle must be full of them.

00:33:38.949 --> 00:33:42.407
Don't you get it?
He's messing with our heads.

00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:44.544
That's what all that
playing God stuff was about.

00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:47.215
He's trying to get us to act good,
save the movie.

00:33:47.324 --> 00:33:50.350
He ain't playing God.
He's being judged by him.

00:33:54.364 --> 00:33:57.060
That's our objective.
Complete the mission.

00:34:03.273 --> 00:34:06.174
No offense, kirk,
I know you're the big fancy actor here,

00:34:06.276 --> 00:34:10.178
but I've done a lot more effects-driven
event films than you. Okay?

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.679
And I think I can spot

00:34:13.784 --> 00:34:15.308
a prop head when I see one.

00:34:15.419 --> 00:34:16.909
Oh, Jesus.

00:34:18.121 --> 00:34:21.613
It's corn syrup, guys.
Corn syrup and latex.

00:34:24.828 --> 00:34:27.956
Warm, blood-flavored corn syrup.

00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:29.191
Oh, God.

00:34:29.833 --> 00:34:32.961
Smoke and mirrors, guys.
Welcome to the movie factory.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:34.264
Oldest trick in the book.

00:34:36.273 --> 00:34:37.570
He getting down now.

00:34:37.674 --> 00:34:39.039
Oh, my God!

00:34:41.845 --> 00:34:43.904
Whoa, look at me!

00:34:44.014 --> 00:34:45.481
You're going to get the shots,

00:34:45.582 --> 00:34:48.574
and I'm going to make sure
because I'm the director.

00:34:48.685 --> 00:34:50.812
I'm from London. I direct plays.

00:34:50.921 --> 00:34:53.947
Hey, Damien! We got our war faces on!

00:35:03.967 --> 00:35:05.662
Look, I'm Dave Beckham.

00:35:15.312 --> 00:35:17.712
So, we gotta
light these boys up today, huh?

00:35:17.814 --> 00:35:20.009
Blow some sense into these young men.

00:35:20.984 --> 00:35:23.885
Hey, I don't want to come off
as weird or anything,

00:35:23.987 --> 00:35:27.923
but I might be your biggest fan. Yeah.

00:35:29.292 --> 00:35:32.784
Tropic thunder.
Kind of like my catcher in the rye.

00:35:34.031 --> 00:35:36.261
Yeah, I've never been in the military,
per se,

00:35:36.366 --> 00:35:38.800
but I have lost an appendage
in the line of duty.

00:35:40.604 --> 00:35:42.834
Driving miss Daisy, first studio gig.

00:35:43.607 --> 00:35:44.665
Yeah.

00:35:45.175 --> 00:35:47.973
It's a pretty cool sidearm you got there.
What is it?

00:35:48.078 --> 00:35:49.739
I don't know what it's called.

00:35:50.881 --> 00:35:55.614
I just know the sound it makes
when it takes a man's life.

00:35:58.755 --> 00:35:59.813
Okay.

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:01.630
Damien, we're go for explosion.

00:36:01.725 --> 00:36:04.523
Ready to kick the tires
and light the fires on your say-so.

00:36:04.628 --> 00:36:06.357
Damien, we're go for explosion.

00:36:07.497 --> 00:36:08.521
Do you copy?

00:36:08.632 --> 00:36:11.499
I got an itchy trigger finger here,
and I'm ready to blow some shit up.

00:36:11.601 --> 00:36:15.230
All right, you happy now?
Can we do the scene?

00:36:15.338 --> 00:36:17.966
Or do you need a formal invitation?
Come on, let's go!

00:36:19.776 --> 00:36:20.868
Here. Okay.

00:36:20.977 --> 00:36:23.172
"Scene 12, exterior,
jungle clearing, day, ambush.

00:36:28.718 --> 00:36:30.652
"Four leaf notices
movement in the brush.

00:36:30.754 --> 00:36:33.780
"A dozen guerrilla fighters
can be seen moving in the tree line.

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.450
"Somewhere a mine explodes."
And you.

00:36:37.794 --> 00:36:39.819
"I got a bad feeling on this one."

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:41.420
- Yeah.
- No, that's your line.

00:36:41.531 --> 00:36:44.398
- I got... now?
- Yeah, but scared. Like, scared.

00:36:44.501 --> 00:36:47.231
- "I got a bad feeling on this one."
- Dude, wait, like how?

00:36:47.337 --> 00:36:49.168
"I got a bad feeling on this one."

00:36:49.272 --> 00:36:51.365
- Okay.
- Action. Go, come on.

00:37:00.383 --> 00:37:03.250
I got a bad feeling
on this one there, fats.

00:37:04.588 --> 00:37:07.989
Our asses don't get fragged
in this bullshit valley,

00:37:08.091 --> 00:37:09.922
first thing I'm doing
is paying my two bucks

00:37:10.026 --> 00:37:11.653
so I can watch Brooklyn bust his cherry

00:37:11.761 --> 00:37:14.457
on a sweet little mama-San's
dinky dau poontang.

00:37:14.564 --> 00:37:17.465
Shit, Brooklyn be bagged and tagged
before he get any cooch.

00:37:17.567 --> 00:37:20.798
He die, he probably die
a coochless motherfucker.

00:37:20.904 --> 00:37:22.303
Zip it, motown.

00:37:22.405 --> 00:37:23.963
Don't you worry, Brooklyn.

00:37:24.074 --> 00:37:26.133
You got a lot of days of fucking
ahead of you.

00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:29.837
Man, I'm thirsty.

00:37:30.947 --> 00:37:35.907
Might as well have some of this
Booty sweat I got back in danang.

00:37:36.786 --> 00:37:40.278
Yo, asshole! This motherfucker's dead!

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:42.187
Ain't no criss angel mindfreak,

00:37:42.292 --> 00:37:45.625
David Blaine trapdoor
horseshit jumping off here!

00:37:45.729 --> 00:37:49.495
Hey! You wanna get on the train here,
or do you wanna ruin another take?

00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:52.932
There ain't no goddamn takes,
ain't no goddamn motion picture!

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:55.667
- You sure?
- Yeah.

00:37:55.772 --> 00:37:57.569
- Yeah?
- For certain, man.

00:37:57.674 --> 00:37:59.574
Then why are you still in character?

00:38:01.144 --> 00:38:03.112
I know, but I don't have to tell you.

00:38:04.247 --> 00:38:05.305
You don't know.

00:38:05.415 --> 00:38:08.350
Man, I don't drop character
till I done a DVD commentary.

00:38:11.121 --> 00:38:13.282
You happy now?
We're out of position for the effects!

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:15.119
Get down, fool!

00:38:16.826 --> 00:38:19.727
Didn't anyone read the script?
This is the ambush!

00:38:21.131 --> 00:38:24.794
- This feels pretty real!
- Exactly! Let's use it.

00:38:35.412 --> 00:38:36.572
Yeah!

00:38:37.847 --> 00:38:39.212
Yeah!

00:38:41.818 --> 00:38:43.080
Eat lead!

00:38:45.055 --> 00:38:47.421
They're busting caps
like a motherfucker down there.

00:38:50.694 --> 00:38:52.787
This is fubar. I say we juice them.

00:38:52.896 --> 00:38:54.386
- What do you think?
- Juice them.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.291
Fuck you, Charlie!

00:39:01.371 --> 00:39:02.838
Big-ass titties!

00:39:08.812 --> 00:39:10.439
Look at that, huh?

00:39:15.719 --> 00:39:16.913
And cut!

00:39:19.189 --> 00:39:21.020
That's the trailer right there.

00:39:21.124 --> 00:39:22.421
Yeah!

00:39:22.525 --> 00:39:24.789
- What do we do now?
- Yeah.

00:39:24.894 --> 00:39:26.418
North. Man said to head north.

00:39:26.529 --> 00:39:29.862
- Did you see me shooting?
- That's how we do. Good work, baby.

00:39:29.966 --> 00:39:31.024
I believed it.

00:39:31.134 --> 00:39:32.294
D'ang kwook river.

00:39:32.936 --> 00:39:34.335
I'm betting
he's got more of these battles

00:39:34.437 --> 00:39:37.167
and viet congs
rigged for us along the way.

00:39:37.274 --> 00:39:41.040
Sergeant osiris, get your men.
Load and lock.

00:39:41.711 --> 00:39:43.474
Real, baby, I'm real.

00:39:44.547 --> 00:39:47.345
Let's go! We got a lot of klicks to cover!

00:39:48.485 --> 00:39:51.511
Hump it up, gentlemen!
Single formation.

00:39:51.621 --> 00:39:53.452
Don't dawdle now!

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:21.846
D-rod, d-rod, this is puddingface.
How are we coming on that hotplate?

00:40:24.487 --> 00:40:27.786
Something's up.
I think we better drag ass back there.

00:40:27.891 --> 00:40:30.587
Make sure Damien ain't forgot
how to use his talkbox again.

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:41.304
Yeah, baby, come on. Just a little taste.

00:40:42.906 --> 00:40:45.033
- What are you doing, Jeff?
- Fucking... nothing, man!

00:40:45.141 --> 00:40:48.474
- I'm eating jellybeans.
- Wow, I love jellybeans. Can I please...

00:40:48.578 --> 00:40:51.308
No, you can't have
any fucking jellybeans.

00:40:51.414 --> 00:40:52.506
They're mine.

00:40:52.615 --> 00:40:53.775
You think
you're the only one who gets sick

00:40:53.883 --> 00:40:55.578
when he doesn't have his jellybeans?

00:40:55.685 --> 00:40:57.084
Boundaries, man. Fuck.

00:41:17.006 --> 00:41:19.702
Hey. I didn't mean to
show you up back there.

00:41:19.809 --> 00:41:23.939
It's just, I feel like we really need
to set the example for the other guys.

00:41:24.047 --> 00:41:25.947
It's gonna be tough,

00:41:26.049 --> 00:41:29.075
but I think Damien's gonna get
some great shit out of us.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.380
Just wish I had
a director like this on Jack.

00:41:32.455 --> 00:41:34.946
On Jack. What? Jack?
What you talking about?

00:41:36.159 --> 00:41:38.127
- Simple Jack.
- Oh, yeah.

00:41:39.629 --> 00:41:42.860
Simple Jack, yeah.
You went all out on that one, huh?

00:41:42.966 --> 00:41:45.230
You did.
Really swung for the fences, huh?

00:41:45.335 --> 00:41:47.735
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

00:41:47.837 --> 00:41:50.738
Yeah, it was an intense experience,
you know.

00:41:51.441 --> 00:41:53.534
I just did the work.

00:41:53.643 --> 00:41:57.443
Watched a lot of retarded people.
Spent time with them. Observed them.

00:41:58.748 --> 00:42:00.909
Watched all the retarded stuff they did.

00:42:01.017 --> 00:42:02.780
Then again,
I always found mere observation

00:42:02.886 --> 00:42:05.184
in and of itself is a tad rudimentary.

00:42:05.288 --> 00:42:08.348
Sometimes, we gotta dig deeper
to mine the true emotional pay dirt.

00:42:08.458 --> 00:42:12.792
Thus, we can diagram the source
of the pain and then live it, you know.

00:42:12.896 --> 00:42:14.955
Yeah, yeah, live it. Yeah, exactly.

00:42:15.064 --> 00:42:17.794
You know, there were times
when I was doing Jack

00:42:17.901 --> 00:42:20.369
that I actually felt retarded,

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:21.835
- like really retarded.
- Oh, yeah.

00:42:21.938 --> 00:42:24.133
I mean, I brushed my teeth retarded,

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.037
- I rode the bus retarded.
- Damn.

00:42:26.142 --> 00:42:29.373
In a weird way,
I had to sort of just free myself up

00:42:29.479 --> 00:42:32.448
to believe that it was okay
to be stupid or dumb.

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:34.107
- To be a moron.
- Yeah.

00:42:34.217 --> 00:42:36.947
- To be moronical.
- Exactly, to be a moron.

00:42:37.053 --> 00:42:38.418
- An imbecile.
- Yeah.

00:42:38.521 --> 00:42:41.388
Like the dumbest motherfucker
that ever lived.

00:42:41.491 --> 00:42:42.651
When I was playing the character.

00:42:42.759 --> 00:42:45.353
- When you was the character.
- Yeah, as Jack, definitely.

00:42:45.462 --> 00:42:47.657
Jack, stupid ass Jack.

00:42:47.764 --> 00:42:49.026
Trying to come back from that.

00:42:49.132 --> 00:42:53.262
In a weird way it was almost like
I had to sort of fool my mind

00:42:53.369 --> 00:42:56.338
into believing that it wasn't retarded,

00:42:56.439 --> 00:42:58.240
and by the end of the whole thing,
I was like,

00:42:58.274 --> 00:43:02.802
"wait a minute, I flushed so much out,
how am I gonna jumpstart it up again?"

00:43:02.912 --> 00:43:04.971
- It's just like... right?
- Yeah.

00:43:05.081 --> 00:43:07.845
You was farting in bathtubs
and laughing your ass off.

00:43:07.951 --> 00:43:09.816
Yeah.

00:43:09.919 --> 00:43:12.217
But simple Jack thought he was smart,

00:43:12.322 --> 00:43:13.619
or rather, didn't think he was retarded,

00:43:13.723 --> 00:43:16.590
so you can't afford to play retarded,
being a smart actor.

00:43:16.693 --> 00:43:19.184
Playing a guy who ain't smart
but thinks he is,

00:43:19.295 --> 00:43:20.922
- that's tricky.
- Tricky.

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:24.557
It's like working with Mercury.
It's high science, man. It's an art form.

00:43:24.667 --> 00:43:26.692
- Yeah.
- You an artist.

00:43:26.803 --> 00:43:28.600
- That's what we do, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:43:28.705 --> 00:43:29.967
Hats off for going there,

00:43:30.073 --> 00:43:32.803
especially knowing how
the academy is about that shit.

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:40.040
- About what?
- You're serious? You don't know?

00:43:42.252 --> 00:43:44.277
Everybody knows
you never go full retard.

00:43:45.822 --> 00:43:47.915
- What do you mean?
- Check it out.

00:43:48.057 --> 00:43:52.153
Dustin Hoffman, rain man, looked
retarded, act retarded, not retarded.

00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:56.358
Count toothpicks, cheat at cards.
Autistic, sure. Not retarded.

00:43:57.233 --> 00:43:59.098
Then you got tom Hanks,
Forrest Gump.

00:43:59.202 --> 00:44:01.500
Slow, yes, retarded, maybe,
braces on his legs.

00:44:01.604 --> 00:44:04.505
But he charmed the pants off Nixon,
and he won a ping-pong competition.

00:44:04.607 --> 00:44:05.631
That ain't retarded.

00:44:05.775 --> 00:44:09.711
And he was a goddamn war hero.
You know any retarded war heroes?

00:44:11.648 --> 00:44:13.639
You went full retard, man.

00:44:15.184 --> 00:44:16.549
Never go full retard.

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:21.115
You don't buy that?
Ask Sean penn, 2001, I am Sam.

00:44:21.224 --> 00:44:24.523
Remember? Went full retard?
Went home empty-handed.

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:37.567
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

00:44:38.241 --> 00:44:40.937
Good job, turd. You killed the director.

00:44:41.044 --> 00:44:42.306
No, that's impossible, man.

00:44:42.412 --> 00:44:45.279
I rigged the whole tree line,
and this is here.

00:44:45.415 --> 00:44:46.939
- He must have missed his mark.
- Missed his mark?

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:48.278
Yeah, this isn't me.

00:44:48.384 --> 00:44:51.182
Come on, let's bag and tag the bastard
and get back to the hotel.

00:44:51.287 --> 00:44:53.983
- You're in a world of hurt, dumbo!
- We're in a world of hurt!

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.285
- You're in trouble.
- This isn't just on me!

00:44:56.392 --> 00:44:58.622
- We're in a... we're together on this.
- Bullshit.

00:44:58.728 --> 00:45:00.195
You're just gonna run away.
You're gonna leave.

00:45:00.296 --> 00:45:02.056
What happened to,
"no man left behind," okay?

00:45:02.065 --> 00:45:04.329
Just wait, just wait! Listen!
Listen, okay?

00:45:04.434 --> 00:45:07.164
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Let me just be real with you, all right?

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:10.569
I almost blinded Jamie Lee Curtis
on freaky Friday, okay?

00:45:10.673 --> 00:45:12.004
This shit will fucking ruin me!

00:45:12.108 --> 00:45:14.068
- Just get off me! You're pathetic.
- No, I'm not.

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:16.578
- Get off me!
- You are not going back!

00:45:19.949 --> 00:45:21.883
- What the fuck?
- Now wait a minute.

00:45:32.261 --> 00:45:34.957
So, what?
We're just supposed to keep walking?

00:45:35.064 --> 00:45:37.931
Try to stay in character.
Remember, we're on camera.

00:45:38.067 --> 00:45:39.067
This thing's too heavy.

00:45:39.135 --> 00:45:40.568
I want the rubber one
that the prop guy gave me.

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:42.934
Where's the fucking prop guy?

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.504
How's it going with that map, chief?

00:45:50.613 --> 00:45:53.207
- Can I have a look at it?
- I got it.

00:45:53.316 --> 00:45:54.874
Yeah, Damien gave it to me,
remember?

00:45:54.984 --> 00:45:56.474
Yeah, but he gave it to you for us.

00:45:56.586 --> 00:45:58.213
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:45:58.321 --> 00:46:00.846
- I got it.
- You got it upside down.

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:01.990
Thank you.

00:46:02.091 --> 00:46:03.649
Letters go one way
and the numbers another.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.318
Dude, I'm trying to...
I got your back, man.

00:46:05.428 --> 00:46:07.191
- Well, I'm cool. All right, I'm cool.
- You are?

00:46:07.296 --> 00:46:09.161
Is your character dyslexic?

00:46:09.265 --> 00:46:10.994
- No, my character's not dyslexic.
- So you a cartographer.

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:12.931
I'm tired, I want to go home.

00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:15.596
Why, so you can get back and make
fatties: Fart 20, or some shit?

00:46:15.672 --> 00:46:18.607
It's fatties: Fart two, there's no... hey,
you wish you had a fatties franchise.

00:46:18.708 --> 00:46:19.988
- What?
- It's fatties: Fart two.

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:21.271
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't want no fatties franchise,

00:46:21.377 --> 00:46:23.777
- I got a diamond toilet.
- Your stupid-ass commercials.

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.347
You're all fucked up, man,
you look tired.

00:46:25.448 --> 00:46:26.574
You look like you bumped your head
or something,

00:46:26.683 --> 00:46:28.514
so I came over to see
if you're fucking all right, that's all.

00:46:28.618 --> 00:46:30.643
- Yeah, why don't you get on point?
- I'm on point right here.

00:46:30.753 --> 00:46:31.777
My farts
are fucking more beautiful than...

00:46:31.888 --> 00:46:34.448
You still got that shit upside down.

00:46:35.058 --> 00:46:36.538
The numbers help, man, the numbers...

00:46:36.559 --> 00:46:38.789
The letters go across the top
and then the numbers.

00:46:38.895 --> 00:46:40.453
- Want the map?
- Yeah, I want the fucking map.

00:46:40.563 --> 00:46:41.996
Well, you can't have it,
'cause Damien gave it me.

00:46:42.098 --> 00:46:45.261
You wish you had my farts,
my farts are fucking music.

00:46:45.368 --> 00:46:47.734
All right. That's enough.

00:46:49.205 --> 00:46:52.936
Everybody's obviously a little bushed
from all this humping.

00:46:53.543 --> 00:46:56.034
So take a chow break. Chow break!

00:46:57.847 --> 00:46:59.405
But stay alert.

00:46:59.982 --> 00:47:03.474
Remember, Charlie don't care
if you're on break or not.

00:47:08.558 --> 00:47:11.493
All right, that's lunch. Coming back
to the same scene afterwards,

00:47:11.594 --> 00:47:12.959
"lost in the goddamn jungle."

00:47:13.062 --> 00:47:14.062
Captain simple Jack.

00:47:15.031 --> 00:47:16.031
Fuck you.

00:47:24.941 --> 00:47:26.499
I fucking hate movies.

00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:31.678
This is bullshit.
I don't wanna be in this shitty movie.

00:47:41.524 --> 00:47:44.288
No! That's my jellybeans! No!

00:47:44.393 --> 00:47:49.057
Kid, grab the bat! Please! Shit!

00:47:49.165 --> 00:47:52.430
- Yo, man, I got a bust-a-nut.
- You go to hell! There he is.

00:47:55.872 --> 00:47:58.807
God damn it! Okay. Where'd he go?

00:47:59.776 --> 00:48:02.256
You little piece of shit!
I'm gonna fucking rip your wings off!

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.206
Sanducci. Hold up, man,
keep it on the down-low.

00:48:08.618 --> 00:48:10.899
I don't really gotta piss.
I'm trying to talk at you, man.

00:48:10.953 --> 00:48:12.580
Bait, I need bait.

00:48:13.723 --> 00:48:17.420
You went to boot camp, right?
You can read a map?

00:48:17.527 --> 00:48:18.755
Yeah, I think so.

00:48:18.861 --> 00:48:21.557
I know speedman
got everyone convinced we out here

00:48:21.664 --> 00:48:25.464
making planet of the apes on YouTube
or some shit, but I don't buy it.

00:48:25.568 --> 00:48:28.036
You wanna step on a real landmine?
You wanna die?

00:48:28.838 --> 00:48:30.533
You wanna get shot
by a real motherfucker?

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.803
- Keep looking ahead, man.
- No, of course not.

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:36.371
Trying to get home, man.

00:48:36.479 --> 00:48:38.140
Got a big job coming up next year.

00:48:38.247 --> 00:48:39.680
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

00:48:39.782 --> 00:48:42.307
It's about Abe Lincoln and John wilkes
booth when they were both young.

00:48:42.418 --> 00:48:43.510
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah.

00:48:43.619 --> 00:48:46.110
- That's a classy picture.
- Dude, you kind of look like Abe.

00:48:46.222 --> 00:48:47.689
Slap a beard on you.

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:49.815
- What's your fucking name?
- Really? It's Kevin.

00:48:49.926 --> 00:48:51.917
- Kevin sandusky.
- Yeah.

00:48:52.595 --> 00:48:56.156
If I can put that map in your hands,
can I count on you?

00:48:56.566 --> 00:49:00.093
- Well, yeah, I guess you can.
- Dynamite. I'm out.

00:49:03.773 --> 00:49:06.207
That smelled just like bologna
for some reason.

00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:08.834
Is anyone gonna fucking help me
get this fucking thing?

00:49:09.545 --> 00:49:12.105
Why are they even out in the daytime?

00:49:14.317 --> 00:49:18.754
I'm gonna level with you, bro.
I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you.

00:49:24.994 --> 00:49:28.760
Lazarus is gonna torpedo the movie.

00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:32.696
He's way out on a limb
with this character,

00:49:32.802 --> 00:49:34.633
and I think he's getting cold feet.

00:49:35.938 --> 00:49:38.736
And the men respect you,
'cause you went to boot camp

00:49:38.841 --> 00:49:40.468
and rehearsal.

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:44.035
- Can I count on you, Kyle.
- It's Kevin.

00:49:44.146 --> 00:49:45.204
Good.

00:49:46.782 --> 00:49:49.649
If you want
I could give the map a look-see.

00:49:49.752 --> 00:49:51.913
- I'll handle the map.
- Okay.

00:49:52.021 --> 00:49:55.252
You stick with the program,
we get this movie in the can,

00:49:55.358 --> 00:49:59.055
I'm thinking there could be
a teen choice award in it for you.

00:49:59.161 --> 00:50:03.359
You have that potential.
They'll slime you, the whole deal.

00:50:03.466 --> 00:50:07.095
- Yeah, that's wicked.
- Good.

00:50:13.009 --> 00:50:15.102
There it is! Yeah, now you're dead!

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:17.507
You o.D.'D!

00:50:19.081 --> 00:50:20.412
Hold up now, Jeff.

00:50:22.818 --> 00:50:24.217
Fucking hell!

00:50:25.855 --> 00:50:28.915
What the hell, Jeff? That's a bat, man!

00:50:29.025 --> 00:50:31.493
I don't have any more jellybeans.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.897
You land there!

00:50:54.817 --> 00:50:57.217
Wow. Look at these ruins.

00:50:59.388 --> 00:51:03.825
- Where the hell are we?
- D'ang kwook river.

00:51:03.926 --> 00:51:06.292
That so? How do you know that?
How you sure?

00:51:06.395 --> 00:51:08.590
Only one way to find out, dude. Let's go.

00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:13.795
Yeah. I'm not feeling so good right now.
Seriously, my skin hurts!

00:51:13.903 --> 00:51:16.337
Enough from the peanut gallery!
Into the water, ladies!

00:51:16.439 --> 00:51:18.507
No, man. Let me take a look at that map
right quick.

00:51:18.674 --> 00:51:20.354
Why is everybody
all obsessed with the map?

00:51:20.376 --> 00:51:22.401
'Cause we're tired
of being your trail donkeys!

00:51:22.511 --> 00:51:24.911
Acting like you some one-man GPS!

00:51:25.014 --> 00:51:28.882
God damn it! We lost!
We fucking super lost, man!

00:51:28.985 --> 00:51:31.112
Tell him, mcclusky.
Tell him what time it is.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.778
I don't believe you people.

00:51:34.523 --> 00:51:36.218
What do you mean "you people"?

00:51:38.894 --> 00:51:41.488
What do you mean, "you people"?

00:51:41.597 --> 00:51:43.588
I think what tugg means is...

00:51:43.699 --> 00:51:45.064
No, look at his eyes, man.

00:51:45.167 --> 00:51:47.897
You people, you actors. You people...
- Look at them beady, white devil eyes.

00:51:48.004 --> 00:51:49.605
I gotta get back to the hotel, for real!

00:51:49.638 --> 00:51:51.606
- Hell, no!
- Silence!

00:51:52.641 --> 00:51:55.303
Chill! All right? Just chill it.

00:51:56.812 --> 00:52:00.009
Now, let's go get those viet congs.

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:02.408
- "Viet cong"!
- What?

00:52:02.918 --> 00:52:05.944
It's "viet cong." There's no "s."
It's already plural.

00:52:06.055 --> 00:52:07.647
You wouldn't say "Chineses."

00:52:09.025 --> 00:52:11.459
All right, that's enough
of this insubordination!

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.358
If the machine breaks down,
we break down.

00:52:14.463 --> 00:52:16.988
Hey, man, you know how in Rambo I,
he was big but a little puffy

00:52:17.099 --> 00:52:18.739
and then Rambo ii,
he got all shredded up?

00:52:18.801 --> 00:52:21.668
- Yeah.
- That's kind of how you look right now.

00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:23.329
- Yeah?
- Not Rambo I but ii.

00:52:23.439 --> 00:52:25.168
- Really?
- Yeah, when he was cut up.

00:52:25.274 --> 00:52:27.640
I'm not that... I mean,
that's what I'm going for, but you know...

00:52:27.743 --> 00:52:30.439
Come on, dude. You more shredded
than a julienne salad, man.

00:52:30.546 --> 00:52:32.036
- Thanks.
- What's the secret, dude?

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:33.513
- It's a diet. I'm just dieting.
- Really?

00:52:33.616 --> 00:52:36.608
'Cause I'm trying to come up a little,
but it's just... it's tough.

00:52:36.719 --> 00:52:38.209
- You look good.
- Any tips?

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.015
- What?
- Any tips, you got?

00:52:40.122 --> 00:52:41.248
There's, like, the pineapple...

00:52:41.357 --> 00:52:43.655
- Give me that goddamn map! Fuck you!
- Hey!

00:52:43.759 --> 00:52:45.351
- Hey!
- All right, now!

00:52:45.461 --> 00:52:47.895
What it is, sikorski?
Tell us where we really at.

00:52:47.997 --> 00:52:49.988
That's fucking bullshit!
It's a chump move.

00:52:50.025 --> 00:52:51.959
We just getting a second opinion, doc.

00:52:53.795 --> 00:52:55.057
We're going the wrong way!

00:52:55.163 --> 00:52:56.255
- Damn!
- Son of a bitch.

00:52:56.365 --> 00:53:00.825
God! I think we were
supposed to be doing this,

00:53:00.936 --> 00:53:03.837
and instead we did this.

00:53:03.939 --> 00:53:07.568
Shit, shit, shit, shitty shit, shit!

00:53:07.676 --> 00:53:10.201
Think you can get us back
to that drop zone, boy?

00:53:11.146 --> 00:53:12.545
This is not cool!

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:16.376
Maybe.

00:53:17.819 --> 00:53:19.309
This is insane!

00:53:20.589 --> 00:53:22.921
Are you really going
to abandon this movie?

00:53:23.725 --> 00:53:25.920
We're supposed to be a unit!

00:53:26.028 --> 00:53:27.552
Suck my unit!

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:30.227
All right, fine.

00:53:30.332 --> 00:53:35.235
- I'll finish it by myself.
- You go be all you can be, man.

00:53:35.337 --> 00:53:37.328
Tugg, you have no idea
where you're going!

00:53:37.439 --> 00:53:39.236
Yes, I do!

00:53:39.341 --> 00:53:43.869
I'm going to, "exterior, rain forest, dusk.

00:53:43.979 --> 00:53:48.439
"Smash cut to four leaf, who treks
alone through a frightening jungle."

00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:50.484
Suck on that unit, kirk!

00:54:04.066 --> 00:54:07.058
Come on, men. Let's get home.

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:49.904
Hello, Mr. mantis. You're beautiful.

00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:54.114
Now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo

00:54:54.216 --> 00:54:55.945
where Hollywood
was split into schisms,

00:54:56.051 --> 00:54:59.452
some studios backing blu-ray disc,
others backing hd DVD.

00:54:59.554 --> 00:55:00.646
People thought it would come down to

00:55:00.755 --> 00:55:03.019
pixel rate or refresh rate,
and they're pretty much the same.

00:55:03.125 --> 00:55:06.925
What it came down to was
a combination of gamers and porn.

00:55:07.028 --> 00:55:08.757
Now, whichever format porno backs

00:55:08.864 --> 00:55:12.698
is usually the one
that becomes the most successful.

00:55:12.801 --> 00:55:15.793
But, you know, Sony,
every playstation 3 has a blu-ray in it.

00:55:15.904 --> 00:55:17.633
You talking to me this whole time?

00:55:18.373 --> 00:55:19.670
I was talking to whoever
was listening to me.

00:55:19.774 --> 00:55:21.241
Jesus Christ, man!

00:55:39.661 --> 00:55:41.720
Booty sweat.

00:55:47.769 --> 00:55:49.168
Oh, God!

00:55:51.406 --> 00:55:55.968
It's cold! It's freezing. I'm fucking cold.

00:55:56.077 --> 00:55:58.272
You want my flak jacket?

00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:02.248
What, are you insane? It's boiling!
It's like a sweat lodge out here!

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:05.183
Keep the volume down on that bitching,
flatch Adams.

00:56:05.287 --> 00:56:07.187
I gotta take a fucking 12-pound shit!

00:56:07.289 --> 00:56:09.257
- How we doing? We making good time?
- We're making good time,

00:56:09.357 --> 00:56:12.485
but there's no way we make it
over that Ridge before sundown.

00:56:12.594 --> 00:56:15.085
All right, fellas,
we're gonna make camp, rest up!

00:56:15.197 --> 00:56:17.495
- Oh, God.
- Y'all might be in for a treat.

00:56:17.599 --> 00:56:18.998
You know,
back before the war broked out,

00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:21.830
I was a saucier in San antone.

00:56:21.937 --> 00:56:24.565
I bet I could collar up
some of them Greens.

00:56:24.673 --> 00:56:28.973
Yeah, noodle some crawfish
out the paddy, yo.

00:56:29.077 --> 00:56:33.104
And maybe some crab apples
for dessert, now, you hear? Hell, yeah!

00:56:34.449 --> 00:56:35.711
Hell, yeah!

00:56:35.817 --> 00:56:40.015
That's how we all talk.
We all talk like this, suh! Yes, suh.

00:56:40.121 --> 00:56:45.354
Yeah, get some crawfish and some ribs.

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:50.329
You're Australian! Be Australian!
Excuse me, kangaroo Jack.

00:56:54.569 --> 00:56:56.969
I get excited about my foods, man.

00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:25.024
Die!

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:41.033
No!

00:58:47.582 --> 00:58:51.882
Dude, dude, what the hell
is going on here? Where are we?

00:58:51.986 --> 00:58:54.386
I have no idea.

00:58:54.489 --> 00:58:57.049
I've never been outside the states.

00:58:57.158 --> 00:58:59.319
Wait, what?
Are you fucking kidding me?

00:58:59.427 --> 00:59:01.418
Did you make this
whole goddamn thing up?

00:59:01.529 --> 00:59:02.894
Dude, were you
even in the fucking service?

00:59:02.997 --> 00:59:05.659
Yes. Of course. Coast guard.

00:59:05.767 --> 00:59:07.667
- Coast guard.
- Sanitation department.

00:59:07.769 --> 00:59:10.465
Oh, my God!
You're a fucking garbage man!

00:59:10.572 --> 00:59:14.303
Damn it. F.L. Tayback lies to me
and the whole goddamn U.S. of a.

00:59:14.409 --> 00:59:17.071
I wrote the book as a tribute!
I'm a patriot!

00:59:17.178 --> 00:59:19.237
Yeah, you're the milli vanilli
of patriots, okay?

00:59:19.347 --> 00:59:21.042
You lied
about fighting the Vietnam war.

00:59:21.149 --> 00:59:24.414
It's like punching the American flag
in the face, God damn it.

00:59:24.519 --> 00:59:25.959
God, and to think I believed in you!

00:59:26.054 --> 00:59:28.420
- I don't wanna be next to you.
- Writers lie all the time.

00:59:28.523 --> 00:59:30.650
Can I be tied to another post? Okay.

00:59:51.968 --> 00:59:53.799
- Rick?
- Tugg.

00:59:53.903 --> 00:59:55.962
I killed one, Rick.

00:59:57.106 --> 00:59:59.506
The thing I love most in the world.

00:59:59.608 --> 01:00:01.439
Vivica, get off the line now!

01:00:03.746 --> 01:00:06.146
A hooker. All right, you killed a hooker.

01:00:06.248 --> 01:00:08.307
Calm down.
Here's what you're gonna do.

01:00:08.417 --> 01:00:09.617
Get your hands on some bleach,

01:00:09.685 --> 01:00:12.051
some hydrogen peroxide
and a shitload of lime.

01:00:12.154 --> 01:00:13.644
No, a panda.

01:00:13.756 --> 01:00:15.519
I killed a panda.

01:00:15.624 --> 01:00:17.421
Amanda? Come on, dude.

01:00:17.526 --> 01:00:19.551
I mean,
that's probably not even her real name.

01:00:19.662 --> 01:00:21.323
No, a panda!

01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:22.795
A panda?

01:00:22.898 --> 01:00:27.535
A sweet, cuddly,
vicious little panda.

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:30.605
Jesus Christ, tugg!
Man, don't scare me like that!

01:00:30.706 --> 01:00:31.866
It's beautiful here.

01:00:31.974 --> 01:00:33.464
You on the set?

01:00:33.576 --> 01:00:34.838
I am the set.

01:00:34.944 --> 01:00:37.913
All right, man.
Hey, how's the TiVo working out?

01:00:38.014 --> 01:00:39.242
Screw TiVo.

01:00:39.348 --> 01:00:41.816
I'm way beyond TiVo.

01:00:41.917 --> 01:00:44.010
Last I checked,
they hadn't hooked it up, though.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.419
Hadn't hooked it up? No TiVo?

01:00:47.523 --> 01:00:49.354
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:00:52.194 --> 01:00:53.661
I've moved on.

01:00:54.397 --> 01:00:56.126
Where have you moved on to?

01:00:56.232 --> 01:00:57.722
Another agency?

01:00:59.268 --> 01:01:00.792
Who's with you?

01:01:00.903 --> 01:01:03.064
It's Nick Stevens, isn't it?
That little fucker.

01:01:03.172 --> 01:01:07.268
You are still my client, tugg speedman!
I am getting the TiVo!

01:01:07.376 --> 01:01:09.571
Jacket's on, I'm out the door!

01:01:09.678 --> 01:01:10.736
Tugg?

01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:15.347
Please don't fire me.

01:01:16.218 --> 01:01:17.412
I did it, I did it!

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.852
Vivica, what do I have scheduled
this afternoon?

01:01:19.955 --> 01:01:22.822
- Two and a half men taping.
- Shit.

01:01:23.826 --> 01:01:24.850
Cancel it.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.621
And get me tugg's tropic thunder
contract.

01:01:26.729 --> 01:01:29.857
I'm going to Grossman's office,
I'm playing the card.

01:01:29.965 --> 01:01:30.965
Okay.

01:01:34.537 --> 01:01:37.438
Oh, mama. Thirsty.

01:01:37.573 --> 01:01:39.632
He doesn't look too good.

01:01:39.742 --> 01:01:44.770
Must drink,
so I can throw something up!

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.007
No, no. Don't drink that water!
That water's like a petri dish!

01:01:47.116 --> 01:01:48.208
No, don't!

01:01:48.317 --> 01:01:50.842
Alpa, do you have any Booty sweat?

01:01:50.953 --> 01:01:53.319
Yeah, get him chugging on
some of alpa's ass water.

01:01:53.422 --> 01:01:55.356
That'll bring him around. It's a cure-all.

01:01:55.458 --> 01:01:57.358
Man, what you coming out
in movies for anyway?

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.121
Did you need another revenue stream?

01:01:59.228 --> 01:02:02.026
For your information,
my revenue stream

01:02:02.131 --> 01:02:04.463
currently generates $2 million a year

01:02:04.567 --> 01:02:06.501
in charitable contributions
for my community.

01:02:06.602 --> 01:02:08.934
- Hot damn.
- And why am I in this movie?

01:02:09.038 --> 01:02:11.370
Maybe I just knew I had to represent,

01:02:11.474 --> 01:02:13.271
because they had one good part
in it for a black man

01:02:13.375 --> 01:02:15.434
and they gave it to crocodile dundee.

01:02:17.046 --> 01:02:20.607
Pump your brakes, kid.
That man is a national treasure.

01:02:20.716 --> 01:02:22.843
I just wanted to throw another shrimp
on your Barbie.

01:02:22.952 --> 01:02:24.078
That shit ain't funny.

01:02:24.186 --> 01:02:26.882
Hey, fellas! It's hot!
We're tired! It stinks!

01:02:26.989 --> 01:02:28.590
I'm just fucking with you,
kangaroo Jack!

01:02:28.657 --> 01:02:30.386
I'm sorry a dingo ate your baby.

01:02:30.493 --> 01:02:32.961
You know that's a true story?
Lady lost her kid.

01:02:33.062 --> 01:02:35.724
- You about to cross some fucking lines.
- Guys, relax and stuff.

01:02:35.831 --> 01:02:36.889
You know what? Fuck that, man!

01:02:36.999 --> 01:02:39.661
I'm sick of this koala-hugging nigger
telling me...

01:02:44.406 --> 01:02:45.964
For 400 years,

01:02:47.009 --> 01:02:49.910
that word has kept us down.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:52.607
What the fuck?

01:02:52.715 --> 01:02:56.481
It took a whole lot of trying
just to get up that hill.

01:02:56.585 --> 01:02:59.486
Now we up in the big leagues,

01:02:59.588 --> 01:03:01.351
getting our turn at bat.

01:03:01.457 --> 01:03:04.119
Long as we live, it's you and me, baby.

01:03:04.793 --> 01:03:08.126
That's the theme song for
the jeffersons. You really need help.

01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:11.358
Yeah. Just 'cause it's the theme song,
don't make it not true.

01:03:11.467 --> 01:03:13.401
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what's true.

01:03:13.502 --> 01:03:16.938
I'm gonna tag you back.
You better believe that, baby.

01:03:17.039 --> 01:03:19.633
Guys! Hey, guys!

01:03:20.242 --> 01:03:22.710
Jeff, stay away from that animal.

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.913
I'm gonna bite his hide. I need...

01:03:28.951 --> 01:03:32.216
I need to wear his stomach skin
like a unitard.

01:03:33.189 --> 01:03:36.488
Ain't nobody doing nothing
to no one or body!

01:03:36.592 --> 01:03:41.461
Now, if Mr. portnoy is feeling
a little flu-ish, don't wanna walk,

01:03:41.564 --> 01:03:43.623
put him up on that cloven-hoof animal!

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.297
We got ground to cover!

01:04:15.297 --> 01:04:18.562
All right, pow camp, scene 67.

01:04:19.468 --> 01:04:21.197
Bring it on, cockburn!

01:04:29.278 --> 01:04:31.712
Maybe he's not, you know,
Ridley Scott or something,

01:04:31.814 --> 01:04:33.611
but I think renny harlin's
a tremendous filmmaker

01:04:33.716 --> 01:04:36.514
like, adventures of Ford fairlane,
you know,

01:04:36.619 --> 01:04:40.248
as far as an Andrew Dice Clay
vehicle goes, it's pretty decent.

01:04:40.356 --> 01:04:42.790
And cliffhanger.
Cliffhanger's incredible.

01:04:42.891 --> 01:04:46.349
As far as the whole like,
man against nature type of movies go,

01:04:46.462 --> 01:04:48.623
it's absolutely amazing.

01:04:48.731 --> 01:04:50.631
Shut the fuck up!

01:04:55.271 --> 01:04:56.932
Who send you here?

01:04:57.039 --> 01:05:01.669
Tayback, John, sergeant,
United States army.

01:05:02.411 --> 01:05:07.815
Serial number 694529987.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:14.612
Perhaps some hot tea
will make conversing

01:05:14.723 --> 01:05:16.486
a little easier.

01:05:20.262 --> 01:05:22.355
My leader's not quite as cordial.

01:05:25.834 --> 01:05:28.701
Look, what? I just thought you might
like some hot tea

01:05:28.804 --> 01:05:32.331
- in order to calm your nerves.
- Tayback, John, sergeant,

01:05:32.474 --> 01:05:37.434
United States army, 694529987.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:43.809
And here's a little message
from my Uncle Sam.

01:05:49.458 --> 01:05:51.824
Dude, you all right?

01:05:51.927 --> 01:05:53.360
Man you totally leaned into that.

01:05:53.462 --> 01:05:56.522
I was pulling it back
and you just came in too...

01:05:56.632 --> 01:05:58.827
Hey, it was an accident, man.

01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:03.304
Come on, good.
You want to keep going?

01:06:03.405 --> 01:06:04.997
- Let's go.
- Get up.

01:06:05.107 --> 01:06:06.699
I rather rot in your v.C. Jail!

01:06:06.809 --> 01:06:10.677
I'll never bend to your will!
You scum! You scum!

01:06:10.779 --> 01:06:12.804
Now say this
and go to the beginning again,

01:06:12.915 --> 01:06:14.678
let's do the tea part, okay?

01:06:16.218 --> 01:06:17.651
Dude, I hope you're not pissed.

01:06:17.986 --> 01:06:19.783
I see moss on both sides of that tree.

01:06:19.888 --> 01:06:23.016
Well, you know, maybe if I wasn't
the only one at boot camp...

01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:25.025
My belly really hurts, you guys!

01:06:25.127 --> 01:06:27.322
I'm not joking around, I'm nauseous.

01:06:27.429 --> 01:06:29.670
Let me off, I gotta puke!
I don't wanna die like hendrix!

01:06:29.765 --> 01:06:31.426
All right. All right.

01:06:36.004 --> 01:06:37.995
Are you okay, Jeff?

01:06:38.107 --> 01:06:39.472
I'm awesome.

01:06:41.877 --> 01:06:43.344
Holy shit!

01:06:47.883 --> 01:06:50.044
Okay. Everyone, down, down, down.

01:06:54.757 --> 01:06:56.247
Man. Now I'm tripping.

01:06:56.358 --> 01:06:58.986
That looks like the pow camp
from out the script, yo.

01:06:59.862 --> 01:07:01.557
Speedman was right?

01:07:01.663 --> 01:07:03.028
I don't think so.

01:07:03.132 --> 01:07:05.362
Look at the cooking vats,
the armed guards.

01:07:06.969 --> 01:07:09.062
Looks like a heroin processing plant.

01:07:10.172 --> 01:07:11.298
We were in that chopper for hours.

01:07:11.407 --> 01:07:13.671
I don't even think
we're in Vietnam anymore.

01:07:13.776 --> 01:07:16.210
- Fuck.
- Shit. We ain't even in 'nam?

01:07:16.311 --> 01:07:19.075
No, most likely Myanmar or Laos.

01:07:19.181 --> 01:07:20.739
What the fuck is Laos?

01:07:20.849 --> 01:07:22.009
It's the golden triangle.

01:07:22.117 --> 01:07:24.085
Oh, fuck. We're dead.

01:07:24.186 --> 01:07:26.154
No one gets out of here. I saw it on TV.

01:07:26.255 --> 01:07:30.282
Fucking boats, airplanes,
ufos and shit, they all just vanish!

01:07:30.392 --> 01:07:32.917
Yo, that's the Bermuda triangle,
dumbass.

01:07:33.028 --> 01:07:35.394
This is the golden triangle.

01:07:35.497 --> 01:07:37.098
It's the world's hard drug superhighway.

01:07:37.166 --> 01:07:38.463
How do you know that?

01:07:38.567 --> 01:07:41.297
It was a really long trip.
I read the in-flight magazine.

01:07:43.105 --> 01:07:44.402
Cut!

01:07:44.506 --> 01:07:45.973
Oh, Jesus!

01:07:46.074 --> 01:07:48.565
What do you see, man? I'm blocked.

01:07:48.677 --> 01:07:50.042
Damien, cut!

01:07:51.814 --> 01:07:53.406
Hey, Damien, cut!

01:07:54.249 --> 01:07:55.910
They got speedman.

01:07:56.485 --> 01:07:57.918
And it doesn't look good.

01:08:30.586 --> 01:08:31.883
I am tran.

01:08:32.855 --> 01:08:35.016
You are a trespasser in my poppy fields.

01:08:36.425 --> 01:08:39.053
You are d.E.A. Scum!

01:08:40.996 --> 01:08:44.432
Were there some re-writes
that I missed?

01:08:50.739 --> 01:08:52.229
Do you want to die?

01:08:53.008 --> 01:08:54.475
- Do you?
- No!

01:08:54.576 --> 01:08:58.706
Please, don't hurt me!

01:09:06.588 --> 01:09:07.782
Say that again.

01:09:08.790 --> 01:09:10.587
Please, don't hurt me.

01:09:10.692 --> 01:09:13.786
No! Like you did before! Say it!

01:09:14.763 --> 01:09:15.763
Say it!

01:09:15.864 --> 01:09:19.857
Please, don't hurt me!

01:09:35.484 --> 01:09:38.078
- What?
- You are simple Jack.

01:09:41.056 --> 01:09:42.921
You saw simple Jack?

01:09:43.025 --> 01:09:45.357
We love the tale of this man,
simple Jack.

01:09:47.062 --> 01:09:48.893
We do not have many luxury here.

01:09:48.997 --> 01:09:51.431
And simple Jack is the only movie
we possess.

01:09:51.533 --> 01:09:55.367
You got the vhs.

01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:57.529
We've watched it many, many times.

01:09:57.639 --> 01:10:00.107
You should've got Oscar.

01:10:03.145 --> 01:10:04.908
Well, you know. It's...

01:10:06.181 --> 01:10:08.777
Just to be nominated...
You were nominated?

01:10:08.884 --> 01:10:10.408
No, no, no. I wasn't nominated.

01:10:10.519 --> 01:10:13.682
I'm just saying that to have been
nominated would have been nice.

01:10:13.789 --> 01:10:16.189
It's just... it's very political.
You have to take out ads...

01:10:16.258 --> 01:10:18.749
- Shut up now!
- Okay. Okay.

01:10:19.595 --> 01:10:21.324
So, are you going to

01:10:22.965 --> 01:10:24.592
let me go, or...

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:26.827
No. We'll hold you for ransom.

01:10:26.935 --> 01:10:28.732
Much more money now!

01:10:40.315 --> 01:10:41.315
He's in a meeting.

01:10:41.416 --> 01:10:44.180
Yeah, I know.
In about two seconds with the pecker.

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:47.085
I'm gonna rip your fucking tits off.

01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:49.851
You wanna talk about trouble?
That's trouble.

01:10:49.958 --> 01:10:51.516
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:10:53.428 --> 01:10:55.328
What do you need, peck?

01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:58.058
No, more like what do you need, les?

01:10:58.166 --> 01:10:59.360
Glasses?

01:11:00.435 --> 01:11:01.493
What?

01:11:01.603 --> 01:11:04.094
So you can read
the tropic thunder contract

01:11:04.206 --> 01:11:06.606
that guarantees my client,
tugg speedman,

01:11:06.708 --> 01:11:10.439
some form of digital video recorder
on location.

01:11:11.213 --> 01:11:13.340
- Huh?
- I can't believe you let him in.

01:11:14.983 --> 01:11:17.816
Look, fuckstick, I'm incredibly busy,
so why don't you get the hell out of here

01:11:17.919 --> 01:11:20.979
before I snap your dick off
and jam it into your ass?

01:11:21.089 --> 01:11:23.114
No, not you, Helen.

01:11:23.225 --> 01:11:26.922
But I will rip your tits off
if you don't get me those theaters.

01:11:27.029 --> 01:11:28.553
Perfect.

01:11:28.664 --> 01:11:31.098
Hey, tuggernuts,
I've got you on speakerphone.

01:11:31.199 --> 01:11:33.064
I'm standing here with les Grossman,

01:11:33.168 --> 01:11:36.331
and he is dying to tell you
why he's apparently wiped his ass

01:11:36.438 --> 01:11:38.736
with the TiVo clause from your contract.

01:11:39.941 --> 01:11:41.932
We are flaming dragon.

01:11:42.044 --> 01:11:44.410
Speedman is with us now.

01:11:44.513 --> 01:11:48.074
For 50 million, you will get him back.

01:11:48.183 --> 01:11:50.344
- Are you gonna get those...
- Who is this?

01:11:50.452 --> 01:11:53.148
- And how did you get this phone?
- We are flaming dragon!

01:11:53.255 --> 01:11:55.155
Simple Jack belong to us now.

01:11:57.893 --> 01:11:59.918
He does, does he?

01:12:00.028 --> 01:12:02.496
Let me tell you something, shitbird.

01:12:02.597 --> 01:12:05.031
I've never even heard
of your little agency.

01:12:05.133 --> 01:12:07.101
But if you think
you can poach my client...

01:12:07.202 --> 01:12:11.730
Send $50 million, or you no see
simple Jack again because we kill him.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.330
This is les Grossman. Who is this?

01:12:13.442 --> 01:12:15.740
This is flaming dragon!

01:12:15.844 --> 01:12:18.608
Okay. Flaming dragon. Fuckface.

01:12:18.714 --> 01:12:23.549
First, take a big step back
and literally fuck your own face!

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.650
Now, I don't know what kind of
pan-pacific bullshit power play

01:12:27.756 --> 01:12:30.224
you're trying to pull here,
but Asia, Jack, is my territory.

01:12:30.325 --> 01:12:31.622
So whatever you're thinking,
you better think again.

01:12:31.727 --> 01:12:33.092
Otherwise, I'm gonna
have to head down there,

01:12:33.195 --> 01:12:36.562
and I will rain down an ungodly
fucking firestorm upon you.

01:12:36.665 --> 01:12:38.292
You're gonna have to call
the fucking united nations

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:42.427
and get a fucking binding resolution
to keep me from fucking destroying you.

01:12:42.537 --> 01:12:45.131
I am talking scorched earth,
motherfucker!

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.003
I will massacre you!

01:12:47.109 --> 01:12:49.043
I will fuck you up!

01:12:56.852 --> 01:12:58.892
- Could you find out who that was? Go.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:34.022 --> 01:13:37.014
You wear these.
More like simple Jack teeth.

01:13:37.125 --> 01:13:38.854
Okay.

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.622
Hey. Look, I know you're a big fan,
and that's great...

01:13:44.699 --> 01:13:46.326
Put teeth in!

01:13:53.441 --> 01:13:55.306
Now do movie.

01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:57.071
The whole movie?

01:13:57.179 --> 01:13:58.840
I can't. I don't know the whole...

01:13:58.947 --> 01:14:01.438
You perform! You perform or die!

01:14:02.184 --> 01:14:03.674
Monkey swine!

01:14:06.588 --> 01:14:07.987
Pa.

01:14:09.958 --> 01:14:11.323
More stupid!

01:14:13.094 --> 01:14:18.157
Pa, why you gotta make me feel bad?

01:14:20.602 --> 01:14:21.933
You saw what I saw.

01:14:22.037 --> 01:14:24.631
Tugg speedman is dead meat
if we don't do something soon.

01:14:24.739 --> 01:14:27.105
Yeah. We could do something
by getting our asses back to the hotel,

01:14:27.209 --> 01:14:28.540
which is in the other direction!

01:14:28.643 --> 01:14:30.235
Ain't right.

01:14:30.345 --> 01:14:32.370
What would've happened
in the great escape

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.314
if Steve McQueen and them dudes
had turned tail and ran?

01:14:36.418 --> 01:14:40.411
Well, that's what that movie was about.
They were escaping. They ran away.

01:14:40.522 --> 01:14:43.150
I'm trying to agree with you.
The point is they did something.

01:14:43.258 --> 01:14:44.452
Then what are we supposed to do, huh?

01:14:44.559 --> 01:14:48.461
'Cause he's cleaning a gun
with no bullets. Yeah, that's a plan.

01:14:48.563 --> 01:14:52.693
I'm just like a little boy,
playing with his dick when he's nervous.

01:14:55.904 --> 01:14:58.395
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:14:58.506 --> 01:15:01.566
I got an idea.
This might be a little crazy.

01:15:01.676 --> 01:15:03.644
Crazy's better than nothing.

01:15:03.745 --> 01:15:07.704
Back in '98, I did a low-budget
titty comedy for skinemax.

01:15:07.816 --> 01:15:11.149
- Sex camp. Remember it?
- Yeah.

01:15:11.253 --> 01:15:15.212
Anyway, me and the campers
from the uncool camp

01:15:15.323 --> 01:15:17.848
had to break into the rich girl camp.

01:15:17.959 --> 01:15:19.654
So, what we did,

01:15:19.761 --> 01:15:22.753
we built a catapult
out of logs and underwear,

01:15:22.864 --> 01:15:26.425
and they shot us over the wall,
and we parachuted down.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:35.567
Look, you guys, we
already know the plan.

01:15:35.677 --> 01:15:37.645
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm giving you gold.

01:15:37.746 --> 01:15:42.115
We do it just like in the book,
chapter 26, the wet offensive.

01:15:42.217 --> 01:15:44.617
The book of tropic thunder.

01:15:44.719 --> 01:15:46.949
Yeah, did you guys read the book?

01:15:48.256 --> 01:15:50.884
The flap, I read the back flap
and saw the pictures.

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.788
Well, it's okay.
It's exactly the same as in the script.

01:15:54.896 --> 01:15:55.954
Cool.

01:15:57.933 --> 01:16:00.493
You guys all read the script, right?

01:16:00.602 --> 01:16:02.695
I don't read the script, script reads me.

01:16:03.872 --> 01:16:05.339
What the hell does that even mean?

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.807
What you getting at with the books,
scripts? Spit that shit out, man!

01:16:12.147 --> 01:16:13.978
All right. The wet offensive.

01:16:15.016 --> 01:16:17.918
Osiris and fats go undercover
as a diversion.

01:16:18.019 --> 01:16:20.351
Motown and Brooklyn sneak in
via the river.

01:16:20.455 --> 01:16:22.855
Yeah. But those dudes
was trained soldiers.

01:16:24.726 --> 01:16:25.784
Yeah!

01:16:26.861 --> 01:16:29.853
And we trained actors, motherfucker.

01:16:29.965 --> 01:16:34.299
Time to man up.
And I ain't gonna sugarcoat.

01:16:34.402 --> 01:16:37.166
Some of us
might not even make it back.

01:16:37.272 --> 01:16:40.366
What do you mean?
Like not on the same flight?

01:16:43.078 --> 01:16:45.842
Alpa and I's already wearing
earth mama's natural night camo.

01:16:45.947 --> 01:16:47.778
- Cool it, Benson.
- Sorry.

01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:53.378
We gonna scout, get a plan together.
We ain't back in 20, come looking.

01:16:54.889 --> 01:16:56.754
We are flaming dragon.

01:17:00.495 --> 01:17:01.689
Okay.

01:17:02.998 --> 01:17:06.092
Flaming dragon's
a heroin manufacturer.

01:17:06.201 --> 01:17:09.295
They're responsible
for an eighth of the drug trade in Asia.

01:17:09.404 --> 01:17:12.635
- Huge profit margin.
- Guys!

01:17:12.741 --> 01:17:15.676
Would somebody please let me know
what the game plan is?

01:17:15.777 --> 01:17:17.506
Peck! We have it handled.

01:17:17.612 --> 01:17:20.103
Please, don't interrupt.
Everything's under control.

01:17:20.215 --> 01:17:22.206
I got it. Got it.

01:17:34.329 --> 01:17:36.559
- Les Grossman.
- We not get money yet.

01:17:37.098 --> 01:17:39.225
Price now 100 million!

01:17:39.334 --> 01:17:42.167
You pay now,
or tomorrow simple Jack die.

01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:45.330
Great. Let me get this down.

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.873
100 million.

01:17:46.975 --> 01:17:49.443
Wait! I got a better idea.

01:17:50.245 --> 01:17:52.076
Instead of 100 million,

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:55.047
how about I send you
a hobo's dick cheese?

01:17:55.150 --> 01:17:57.470
Then you kill him! Do your thing!
Skin the fucking bastard!

01:17:57.552 --> 01:17:59.747
Go to town, man! Go to town!

01:17:59.854 --> 01:18:02.015
- No...
- In the meantime, and as usual,

01:18:02.123 --> 01:18:03.784
go fuck yourself!

01:18:04.893 --> 01:18:07.453
- No.
- We don't negotiate with terrorists.

01:18:09.564 --> 01:18:12.294
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, are you insane?

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.231
- I think I could've done that better.
- I thought it was good.

01:18:14.335 --> 01:18:16.200
They're gonna kill him!

01:18:19.274 --> 01:18:20.332
And?

01:18:22.677 --> 01:18:23.803
"And?"

01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:29.207
It's a cold, hard world. Shit happens.

01:18:31.519 --> 01:18:34.716
We'll weep for him, in the press.

01:18:34.856 --> 01:18:37.518
Set up a scholarship in his name.

01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:41.561
Eventually, and I'm talking way,
way down the road,

01:18:41.663 --> 01:18:43.153
we file an insurance claim.

01:18:43.264 --> 01:18:46.062
Preferably before
the end of the fiscal year.

01:18:46.167 --> 01:18:49.898
Actually, the claim alone would net us
more than the movie would lose.

01:18:52.006 --> 01:18:53.769
You can't be serious.

01:18:55.009 --> 01:18:56.567
You kick in the door to my house,

01:18:56.678 --> 01:19:02.139
all ants in your pants,
sucking my left nut to get a TiVo scrap

01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:06.846
for the third runner-up
sexiest man alive 1998,

01:19:06.955 --> 01:19:09.321
and you're asking if I'm serious?

01:19:13.194 --> 01:19:14.889
Let's face it.

01:19:14.996 --> 01:19:19.023
The kids aren't dressing up as scorcher
for purim anymore.

01:19:20.435 --> 01:19:23.427
Speedman is a dying star,

01:19:23.538 --> 01:19:26.769
a white dwarf heading for a black hole.

01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:29.605
That's physics. It's inevitable.

01:19:29.711 --> 01:19:33.044
We've been handed
an incredible opportunity here, peck.

01:19:33.148 --> 01:19:36.982
The universe is talking to us right now.

01:19:37.085 --> 01:19:38.643
You just gotta listen.

01:19:51.766 --> 01:19:55.361
See, this is the good part, pecker.
This is when the job gets fun.

01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:56.562
Yeah.

01:19:56.671 --> 01:19:59.834
Ask and you shall receive.

01:20:00.875 --> 01:20:05.005
- All right.
- You play ball, we play ball.

01:20:05.113 --> 01:20:08.480
I know you want the goodies.

01:20:08.583 --> 01:20:10.574
Welcome to the goody room.

01:20:10.685 --> 01:20:15.315
You paying attention?
'Cause I'm talking g5 for the pecker.

01:20:15.423 --> 01:20:16.685
That's how you're gonna roll.

01:20:16.791 --> 01:20:20.750
No more frequent flier
bitch Miles for my boy.

01:20:20.862 --> 01:20:22.159
Yeah!

01:20:22.664 --> 01:20:23.926
Playa.

01:20:24.799 --> 01:20:26.130
Playa!

01:20:27.168 --> 01:20:28.465
Big dick playa.

01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:30.561
Swinging past your knees!

01:20:30.672 --> 01:20:31.696
Big dick, baby.

01:20:31.806 --> 01:20:33.000
Yep.

01:20:36.344 --> 01:20:38.938
Or you can grow a conscience

01:20:39.047 --> 01:20:41.413
in the next five minutes
and see where that takes you.

01:20:46.387 --> 01:20:48.480
Let me get this straight.

01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:52.219
You want me
to let my client of 15 years,

01:20:52.327 --> 01:20:53.692
one of my best friends,

01:20:53.795 --> 01:20:58.425
die in the jungle, alone,
for some money and a g5?

01:20:59.567 --> 01:21:00.693
Yes.

01:21:05.773 --> 01:21:08.037
A g5 airplane?

01:21:10.144 --> 01:21:11.202
Yes.

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.976
And lots of money.

01:21:16.351 --> 01:21:18.512
Playa.

01:21:21.422 --> 01:21:22.616
Yeah!

01:21:23.858 --> 01:21:26.452
Smack it up, flip it, rub it down!

01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:31.692
But mama take care of Jack a lot.

01:21:32.533 --> 01:21:36.264
How many more sleeps
before she wakes up again?

01:21:36.371 --> 01:21:37.895
Sorry, Jack.

01:21:38.006 --> 01:21:40.270
She in heaven now.

01:21:41.042 --> 01:21:44.307
Damn! I thought the movie was bad.

01:21:44.412 --> 01:21:47.540
She sleep forever.

01:21:47.649 --> 01:21:50.777
To the man's credit, he's actually
eased up on the retard throttle.

01:21:50.885 --> 01:21:54.480
And now that's added a balance,
and the audience can connect.

01:21:54.589 --> 01:21:58.389
I mean, this is theater 101,
but, you know, he's had a tough road.

01:21:58.493 --> 01:21:59.619
He'll become a naturalist.

01:21:59.727 --> 01:22:01.447
- Yeah.
- Break down the aesthetic distance,

01:22:01.529 --> 01:22:03.258
then the...

01:22:05.933 --> 01:22:07.560
Told you I'd tag you back.

01:22:10.238 --> 01:22:12.502
Can I tell you that I'm sorry

01:22:12.607 --> 01:22:14.905
for any offense I might've caused, man?

01:22:15.009 --> 01:22:17.375
- I just got caught up in...
- In being a dumbass?

01:22:17.478 --> 01:22:18.877
I guess so.

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:21.676
Why you still doing this
chicken George shit, I have no idea.

01:22:21.783 --> 01:22:23.080
- Neither do I.
- It's beyond me.

01:22:23.184 --> 01:22:25.379
- It's beyond me.
- You confused.

01:22:25.486 --> 01:22:27.420
- I am a little confused.
- I know.

01:22:29.023 --> 01:22:30.820
But are we cool?

01:22:30.925 --> 01:22:32.256
Not really.

01:22:36.064 --> 01:22:37.656
Hey, man.

01:22:37.765 --> 01:22:39.460
- How's it going?
- Good. Yourself?

01:22:39.567 --> 01:22:41.592
Hey, so, if it's no big deal,

01:22:41.703 --> 01:22:44.570
I think I'm just gonna hang back here
for the mission.

01:22:44.672 --> 01:22:46.299
Watch the stuff.

01:22:46.407 --> 01:22:48.432
- Is that cool?
- What? No!

01:22:48.543 --> 01:22:50.443
We need you, Jeff.

01:22:50.545 --> 01:22:52.137
What are you talking about?

01:22:52.246 --> 01:22:53.804
Okay, look, man.

01:22:55.049 --> 01:22:57.347
- I got something to tell you.
- Okay.

01:22:59.587 --> 01:23:02.317
You know those jellybeans
I was eating?

01:23:02.423 --> 01:23:05.517
Well, they weren't jellybeans, okay?

01:23:06.427 --> 01:23:09.225
- They were drugs.
- Really?

01:23:09.330 --> 01:23:13.699
I get down there near the mother lode,
I am done. I'm jonesing bad, man.

01:23:13.801 --> 01:23:16.736
I'm gonna fucking do all the heroin
in the fucking world.

01:23:20.041 --> 01:23:24.205
If you guys wanna make it through
this thing, you gotta strap me to a tree.

01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:29.346
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious. Literally, a tree.

01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:32.330
And you can, no matter what, you can't
fucking untie me until it is done,

01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:33.978
until it is out of my system.

01:23:34.088 --> 01:23:35.715
I'm gonna say,
"hey, man, I'm cool. It's cool.

01:23:35.823 --> 01:23:37.381
"I'm finally better. I'm finally better.
Untie me."

01:23:37.492 --> 01:23:40.689
Don't listen to me!
Anything I fucking say is a lie!

01:23:40.795 --> 01:23:42.126
You got it!

01:23:42.797 --> 01:23:44.856
Goodbye, mama!

01:23:44.966 --> 01:23:48.094
Now you can have ice cream in heaven.

01:23:48.202 --> 01:23:53.162
I'll see you tonight, when I go to bed,
in my head movies.

01:23:54.108 --> 01:23:58.704
But this head movie
makes my eyes rain.

01:24:07.755 --> 01:24:10.986
Dang.
Short-bus is taking some real hits.

01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:15.658
- They got him on the move!
- That's torture, man.

01:24:15.797 --> 01:24:18.664
Okay. That's where they keeping him.

01:24:18.766 --> 01:24:20.961
I gotta get cracking on my costume.

01:24:21.068 --> 01:24:22.467
Say, are you good
with a needle and thread?

01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:23.594
Hell, yeah.

01:24:23.704 --> 01:24:27.037
Alpa chino chinos sold more than
five million pairs last spring at the gap.

01:24:27.141 --> 01:24:29.837
- I sewed them patterns myself, baby.
- Let's roll out.

01:25:01.843 --> 01:25:04.073
It's a little twig man Oscar.

01:25:10.685 --> 01:25:13.085
I'm going to call you half squat.

01:25:14.789 --> 01:25:16.757
And you can call me

01:25:17.825 --> 01:25:19.122
papa.

01:25:42.617 --> 01:25:44.346
Wow, look at all those stars.

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.288
Really makes a guy feel pretty small.

01:25:49.824 --> 01:25:52.384
This could be the last time
we look at these stars.

01:25:53.361 --> 01:25:54.828
Man, that's beauty.

01:25:56.764 --> 01:25:59.824
Nights like tonight
make a man wonder what it's all about.

01:25:59.934 --> 01:26:02.232
Hey, you guys.
Anybody got some bug spray?

01:26:04.071 --> 01:26:05.197
Don't ignore me!

01:26:05.306 --> 01:26:08.173
Stick it out, man.
We're gonna get through this.

01:26:09.310 --> 01:26:11.369
- Hey, kirk?
- Yeah?

01:26:11.479 --> 01:26:14.312
Are you still dating
Jennifer love Hewitt?

01:26:14.415 --> 01:26:15.814
'Cause I think she's hot.

01:26:15.917 --> 01:26:19.284
No, that was just some
tabloid conjecture.

01:26:19.387 --> 01:26:23.380
Hey, guys, I'm good. I made it through.
You can untie me now.

01:26:24.458 --> 01:26:25.789
Funny, huh?

01:26:25.893 --> 01:26:28.794
The circus life 280 days a year
on location.

01:26:30.031 --> 01:26:32.932
It's hard to find a girl
that can hang with that, you know?

01:26:34.735 --> 01:26:36.794
Not one worth keeping, nohow.

01:26:36.904 --> 01:26:39.202
Hey, radar? Evans?

01:26:39.307 --> 01:26:40.365
No, it's Kevin.

01:26:40.474 --> 01:26:42.203
Kev, whatever the fuck.
Come over here.

01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:44.540
I didn't tell you, but fatties: Fart three
is coming down the pike,

01:26:44.645 --> 01:26:48.137
and there's a role in there for you
if you come over and untie me.

01:26:48.249 --> 01:26:50.809
Jeff, you're just going to
have to tough it out.

01:26:50.918 --> 01:26:52.886
Your mother's a cankerous whore!

01:26:52.987 --> 01:26:54.318
Jesus, man.

01:26:55.356 --> 01:26:56.823
Hey, man.

01:26:56.924 --> 01:26:59.825
Remember way back when I said
your mother was a cankerous whore?

01:26:59.927 --> 01:27:03.328
I'm sorry, man.
I did not mean that. She's not.

01:27:03.431 --> 01:27:05.126
How about you, man?

01:27:05.266 --> 01:27:07.700
You got some little minx waiting for you
on the other side of tomorrow?

01:27:07.802 --> 01:27:09.269
Me?

01:27:09.370 --> 01:27:12.134
I've barely even had a girlfriend, and...

01:27:12.974 --> 01:27:16.637
I was really hoping I'd get laid
when this movie came out,

01:27:16.744 --> 01:27:19.144
but that's not gonna happen.

01:27:20.014 --> 01:27:21.481
What about you, masterblaster?

01:27:21.582 --> 01:27:24.263
You got a certain someone you trying
to get with back in the states?

01:27:24.318 --> 01:27:29.051
What, alpa chino?
He's like 10 girls deep, 24/7.

01:27:29.156 --> 01:27:30.384
No. You missing me, man.

01:27:30.491 --> 01:27:32.288
I'm talking about something special.
Big difference.

01:27:32.393 --> 01:27:33.587
How about it?

01:27:34.362 --> 01:27:35.488
Yeah.

01:27:36.897 --> 01:27:38.865
Yeah, there is.

01:27:38.966 --> 01:27:42.299
Well? What's the skinny?
Y'all been on a date or what?

01:27:42.403 --> 01:27:44.303
No. I mean...

01:27:44.405 --> 01:27:49.240
I always wanted to, but I guess
I just never had the courage to ask.

01:27:49.343 --> 01:27:51.038
It's... it's complicated.

01:27:51.145 --> 01:27:53.579
No! It's simple as pie, man.

01:27:53.681 --> 01:27:56.275
You plant your feet in the ground, you
look her square in the eyes, you say,

01:27:56.384 --> 01:28:00.013
"hey, baby, you and me's going
on a date." That's the end of story.

01:28:00.121 --> 01:28:02.817
- What's her name?
- Lance.

01:28:02.923 --> 01:28:04.686
"Listen here, Lance..."

01:28:05.559 --> 01:28:09.359
Lance? What the fuck did I just hear?
Lance?

01:28:09.463 --> 01:28:11.192
- Did you say "Lance"?
- No!

01:28:11.298 --> 01:28:13.258
- That sounded like "Lance."
- No, I said "Nance."

01:28:13.334 --> 01:28:15.575
- That's what I said, "Nance."
- It sounded like "Lance."

01:28:15.603 --> 01:28:17.127
Look, I'm alpa chino, okay?

01:28:17.238 --> 01:28:18.899
I love the pussy! All right?

01:28:19.006 --> 01:28:20.906
Lay your ass back down
and look at the stars.

01:28:21.042 --> 01:28:22.373
When you wrote I love tha pussy

01:28:22.476 --> 01:28:25.843
was you thinking of dangling your dice
on Lance's forehead?

01:28:25.946 --> 01:28:28.312
Oh, hell, no! What? Come on. Look.

01:28:28.416 --> 01:28:31.351
- Man, everyone's gay once in a while.
- I'm not gay!

01:28:31.452 --> 01:28:32.476
This Hollywood.

01:28:32.586 --> 01:28:33.644
How about we all get back to work?

01:28:33.754 --> 01:28:35.415
- Okay. Cool.
- This is ridiculous!

01:28:35.523 --> 01:28:38.424
We got a big day tomorrow.
Let's get focused.

01:28:40.995 --> 01:28:45.830
Alpa, if you untie me,
I will literally suck your dick right now.

01:28:45.933 --> 01:28:49.164
I told you, for the last time,
I love the pussy!

01:28:50.538 --> 01:28:53.371
I'll cradle the balls, stroke the shaft,

01:28:53.474 --> 01:28:56.568
work the pipe and swallow the gravy.

01:28:56.677 --> 01:28:58.736
Get it over here, buddy. Let's do this.

01:29:05.319 --> 01:29:06.377
Okay, so, what's the plan?

01:29:06.487 --> 01:29:07.886
Are you gonna talk vietnamese
to those dudes?

01:29:07.988 --> 01:29:09.751
No. No. Mandarin Chinese.

01:29:09.857 --> 01:29:11.552
Which, from what I can tell,
is what they speaking down there.

01:29:11.659 --> 01:29:13.217
How the hell do you know Chinese?

01:29:13.327 --> 01:29:16.785
Land of silk and money with gong li.
Second globe, third Oscar.

01:29:16.897 --> 01:29:20.856
Prepped for that one by working in
a Beijing textile factory for eight months.

01:29:20.968 --> 01:29:22.902
That might be our ride.

01:29:39.653 --> 01:29:40.881
The straps are too tight!

01:29:40.988 --> 01:29:43.354
Shut your mouth and follow my lead.

01:30:11.252 --> 01:30:14.221
The straps are cutting off
my circulation!

01:30:14.321 --> 01:30:15.321
Fuck you!

01:30:22.797 --> 01:30:25.698
Not the fucking bull again.
Fucking asshole.

01:31:19.753 --> 01:31:22.449
Laz, don't let him take me off the yak.

01:31:26.961 --> 01:31:29.225
Bitch whore! Fucking hate you!

01:31:39.373 --> 01:31:40.567
Okay.

01:31:42.776 --> 01:31:44.334
All right.

01:31:44.445 --> 01:31:46.845
That looks like it could be
the munitions hut right there.

01:31:46.947 --> 01:31:49.006
I'm gonna try to find speedman
in the main building.

01:32:06.901 --> 01:32:10.598
I don't know Chinese but it sounds like
your improvising is for shit.

01:32:10.704 --> 01:32:11.830
Oh, fuck!

01:32:27.354 --> 01:32:28.946
Get over here!

01:32:30.324 --> 01:32:31.882
- What are you guys doing here?
- He has hands.

01:32:31.992 --> 01:32:34.392
- He killed Damien.
- Bullshit!

01:32:34.495 --> 01:32:36.986
- He blinded Jamie Lee Curtis.
- Almost!

01:32:37.097 --> 01:32:40.294
What are you talking about?
Damien stepped on a old landmine.

01:32:40.401 --> 01:32:41.959
Sweet. Thank God.

01:32:42.069 --> 01:32:44.264
- We busting speedman out.
- Speedman's here?

01:33:12.433 --> 01:33:15.027
I take it y'all are doing
the wet offensive from the book.

01:33:15.135 --> 01:33:16.397
I can give y'all a diversion.

01:33:16.503 --> 01:33:20.439
I got enough shit here to light this place
up like it's the fourth of fucking July.

01:34:01.915 --> 01:34:04.383
Yes, your farm.

01:34:08.756 --> 01:34:11.156
Where is your farm,

01:34:12.726 --> 01:34:14.193
American?

01:34:17.031 --> 01:34:18.293
My farm?

01:34:20.234 --> 01:34:21.496
Oh, shit.

01:34:22.269 --> 01:34:25.466
Here's my motherfucking farm!

01:34:25.572 --> 01:34:27.062
Yeah!

01:34:32.012 --> 01:34:35.004
Yeah! Chicka-chickaw, baby!

01:34:36.016 --> 01:34:37.210
Kwan-lo!

01:34:38.719 --> 01:34:40.619
I'm a lead farmer, motherfucker!

01:34:41.121 --> 01:34:42.281
Yeah!

01:34:43.857 --> 01:34:47.054
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
keep your head down!

01:34:47.161 --> 01:34:49.425
Keep your head down on the ground!

01:34:49.530 --> 01:34:51.691
Nobody move or I do the little big guy!

01:34:51.799 --> 01:34:55.235
That's right,
we running this program now, j.P.

01:34:55.335 --> 01:34:57.963
Now show me where the drugs are.

01:34:58.072 --> 01:34:59.869
What the fuck?

01:34:59.973 --> 01:35:01.668
That ain't the plan!

01:35:01.775 --> 01:35:03.470
Don't judge me!

01:35:07.147 --> 01:35:08.910
He's got a real serious problem.

01:35:09.716 --> 01:35:11.980
Hey! Hey, you!

01:35:12.086 --> 01:35:16.049
Take off your clothes!

01:35:16.156 --> 01:35:17.453
What do we do now?

01:35:17.558 --> 01:35:19.389
Stick with the plan. Find speedman.

01:35:19.493 --> 01:35:21.893
Alpa, keep this clown posse down.
Come on now.

01:35:21.995 --> 01:35:25.362
Y'all heard the man.
Be suede, don't move!

01:35:25.466 --> 01:35:27.366
Fuck your do-rag. Fuck your do-rag.

01:35:27.468 --> 01:35:29.959
- Door!
- One, two, three!

01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:45.081
I go high, you go low.

01:35:49.456 --> 01:35:53.324
Get down. Get down! Get down!
Chow yun-fat, get the hell down!

01:35:53.427 --> 01:35:56.726
If I see one more head pop up,
it's gonna be bullet whac-a-mole.

01:35:58.298 --> 01:35:59.731
Come on, come on!

01:35:59.833 --> 01:36:01.824
- Smoke grenade.
- Don't drop it now.

01:36:02.503 --> 01:36:04.061
Here.

01:36:04.171 --> 01:36:06.568
- What's this?
- I don't know what it's called.

01:36:06.673 --> 01:36:09.267
I just know the sound it makes
when it lies.

01:36:09.376 --> 01:36:12.903
Don't move, matchbox,
or I will shoot you.

01:36:13.013 --> 01:36:15.880
I'm gonna put on this thing. Don't move.

01:36:15.983 --> 01:36:17.712
I can still see you.

01:36:23.857 --> 01:36:24.949
Tugg!

01:36:27.494 --> 01:36:28.654
Tugg?

01:36:30.731 --> 01:36:31.925
Gotcha.

01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:36.001
Roll your shit up, man. We going home.

01:36:36.103 --> 01:36:37.229
Home?

01:36:39.373 --> 01:36:43.207
But I'm doing five shows a day
for a standing-room-only crowd.

01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:45.870
Don't you get it? I already am home.

01:36:48.182 --> 01:36:51.310
All right, now, dude, you gotta get it...

01:36:51.418 --> 01:36:53.613
My son gave this to me.

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:57.212
- That's your stick buddy?
- His name is twigman.

01:36:57.324 --> 01:36:59.155
Does he wanna come with us?

01:37:20.147 --> 01:37:22.274
Get down! Get down! Get down!

01:37:22.382 --> 01:37:27.342
Maybe y'all heard of me.
Y'all heard of alpa chino? No?

01:37:27.454 --> 01:37:29.922
I love that pussy, hell, yeah, hell, yeah

01:37:30.023 --> 01:37:31.149
they're not your demo, dude.

01:37:31.625 --> 01:37:34.025
Come on.
Six motherfucking vmas, baby.

01:37:34.127 --> 01:37:37.324
Two bet awards. Alpa chino.

01:37:37.431 --> 01:37:43.836
Like him in carlito's way?

01:37:44.204 --> 01:37:46.866
Hey, yo, you know what?
Speak English. I don't speak that stuff.

01:37:46.974 --> 01:37:48.908
What're you sayin'? Huh?

01:37:49.009 --> 01:37:53.571
Devil's advocate. Dog day afternoon.

01:37:53.947 --> 01:37:56.780
Cruising. Sea of love.

01:37:56.883 --> 01:37:59.875
Real Al Pacino.

01:37:59.987 --> 01:38:03.582
Get the fuck down. That's a whole
different dude altogether.

01:38:03.690 --> 01:38:06.750
What you doing? What you doing?
Don't touch that gun.

01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:08.259
Don't do it! Don't touch that gun!

01:38:08.362 --> 01:38:10.660
On my momma, if you touch that gun...

01:38:15.302 --> 01:38:17.702
- Oh, shit, it's on!
- Over here!

01:38:52.105 --> 01:38:53.868
- What're you doing?
- I'm gonna give these boys

01:38:53.974 --> 01:38:55.601
a hanoi high-five.

01:39:08.255 --> 01:39:09.620
Shadow me, Pinocchio!

01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:11.618
Smoke!

01:39:17.464 --> 01:39:19.159
Oh, shit!

01:39:24.004 --> 01:39:25.528
Jeff, don't!

01:39:26.373 --> 01:39:28.364
It doesn't matter what I do.

01:39:28.475 --> 01:39:31.444
I'll always be a screw-up.
No one'll ever respect me.

01:39:31.545 --> 01:39:35.538
That is not true, you are not a screw-up!
You make so many people laugh.

01:39:35.649 --> 01:39:37.879
They only laugh at my farts.

01:39:37.984 --> 01:39:39.975
Jeff, we really need to go now!

01:39:40.087 --> 01:39:41.679
This is all I deserve!

01:40:01.842 --> 01:40:04.072
Laugh at that, you bastards!

01:40:04.177 --> 01:40:07.578
Hilarious! Hilarious!

01:40:09.116 --> 01:40:11.949
Let's move. We only have 16 hours
before they wake up.

01:40:28.235 --> 01:40:29.827
Sounds like the dinner bell's ringing.

01:40:29.936 --> 01:40:32.871
These assholes are gonna be crawling
in here ready to fucking eat us.

01:40:35.809 --> 01:40:38.676
There. All right, you keep six right here.

01:40:40.614 --> 01:40:42.775
Come on, let's go.

01:40:42.883 --> 01:40:44.817
Come on, what are you guys doing?
Let's get out of here!

01:40:44.918 --> 01:40:46.579
He's on tilt status.

01:40:46.686 --> 01:40:50.645
Same thing happened to me when
I played Neil Armstrong in moonshot.

01:40:50.757 --> 01:40:52.850
They found me in an alley in Burbank

01:40:52.959 --> 01:40:56.190
trying to re-enter the earth's
atmosphere in an old refrigerator box.

01:40:56.930 --> 01:40:57.988
What're you talking about?

01:40:58.098 --> 01:41:00.464
Come on, fellas, we really need to go.

01:41:00.567 --> 01:41:05.004
Daggomit, blamtucky,
I ain't re-programming a vcr.

01:41:10.911 --> 01:41:13.141
Give me the flame thrower.
You gotta start the chopper.

01:41:13.246 --> 01:41:16.682
- No, fuck that! Just give me this.
- No time! I'll take care of this!

01:41:17.918 --> 01:41:19.818
All right. Give me your hooks.

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:21.547
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna put them on again.

01:41:21.655 --> 01:41:24.488
- Just give me your goddamn hooks.
- All right. Here.

01:41:24.591 --> 01:41:26.752
Get those boys back to the bird, pronto!

01:41:31.698 --> 01:41:33.859
Shit! Enough!

01:41:33.967 --> 01:41:35.867
Fake shit!

01:41:38.972 --> 01:41:40.098
Fuck!

01:41:47.814 --> 01:41:50.977
Go get your guys!
Get them to the chopper!

01:41:51.084 --> 01:41:53.177
I'll take care of these yahoos!

01:41:55.222 --> 01:41:57.486
You're gonna focus up now,
motherfucker, and say it.

01:41:57.591 --> 01:41:59.718
- "It's me, tugg!"
- It's me, tugg.

01:41:59.826 --> 01:42:01.293
That's right! Now, tugg who?

01:42:01.394 --> 01:42:04.192
- Tugg who? I don't know. Who are you?
- Me?

01:42:04.297 --> 01:42:05.992
I know who I am!

01:42:06.099 --> 01:42:09.830
I'm a dude playing a dude
disguised as another dude.

01:42:09.936 --> 01:42:10.994
What?

01:42:11.104 --> 01:42:13.197
You a dude
that don't know what dude he is!

01:42:13.306 --> 01:42:16.002
Or are you a dude who has no idea
what dude he is

01:42:16.109 --> 01:42:17.371
and claims to know what dude he is...

01:42:17.477 --> 01:42:19.240
What the fuck
are you guys talking about?

01:42:19.346 --> 01:42:20.438
By playing other dudes?

01:42:20.547 --> 01:42:21.741
I know what dude I am!

01:42:21.848 --> 01:42:24.646
- You're scared.
- I ain't scared. Scared of what?

01:42:24.751 --> 01:42:26.013
Or scared of who?

01:42:26.119 --> 01:42:28.713
- Scared of who?
- Come on, guys. We really need to go!

01:42:28.822 --> 01:42:30.084
Scared of you.

01:42:34.995 --> 01:42:37.327
- Jesus.
- What's going on?

01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:38.954
The dudes are emerging.

01:42:39.065 --> 01:42:40.396
He's right, you know.

01:42:42.168 --> 01:42:43.567
I am not

01:42:45.138 --> 01:42:46.833
sergeant Lincoln osiris.

01:42:51.244 --> 01:42:52.711
We gotta roll out.

01:42:52.812 --> 01:42:56.043
Nor am I father O'Malley.

01:42:58.285 --> 01:43:01.220
Or Neil Armstrong.

01:43:08.795 --> 01:43:10.956
I think I might be nobody.

01:43:12.365 --> 01:43:13.525
Wow!

01:43:13.633 --> 01:43:16.295
The insecurity level
with you guys is ridiculous!

01:43:17.571 --> 01:43:20.540
- Everybody's got issues!
- Yeah, man, everybody got issues.

01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:23.200
Come on! You're kirk Lazarus.

01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:25.471
You're the whole reason
I got into acting.

01:43:25.579 --> 01:43:27.410
I memorized every single monologue

01:43:27.514 --> 01:43:30.108
you ever did
when I was in theater school.

01:43:30.216 --> 01:43:32.241
- Really?
- Yeah. And look, tugg!

01:43:32.352 --> 01:43:34.786
I saw scorcher I
24 times when I was in eighth grade.

01:43:34.888 --> 01:43:37.857
That shit blew me away!
I got high to that shit! You the man!

01:43:37.958 --> 01:43:41.086
Yeah, man, scorcher I was great.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

01:43:41.194 --> 01:43:45.324
Tugg, tugger, you're the last piece
of the puzzle, buddy.

01:43:45.432 --> 01:43:48.424
We need you! Your men need you!
Are you with us?

01:43:52.772 --> 01:43:54.763
I'm a rooster illusion.

01:43:54.874 --> 01:43:56.068
Fuck it. We'll deal with him later.

01:43:56.176 --> 01:43:59.339
Let's move. Come on. Come on.
Double time. Gotta go!

01:44:01.881 --> 01:44:03.678
Come on, come on, come on.

01:44:07.454 --> 01:44:09.388
Bingo! Move out.

01:44:11.324 --> 01:44:12.689
Oh, God.

01:44:14.661 --> 01:44:17.528
Just say no to this,
you drug-making midget.

01:44:22.102 --> 01:44:23.569
Gotta hold on!

01:44:29.743 --> 01:44:31.108
Four leaf!

01:44:35.849 --> 01:44:37.180
You grew hands?

01:44:46.426 --> 01:44:47.950
Rpg, gentlemen!

01:44:50.730 --> 01:44:52.254
Where are you going?

01:44:57.771 --> 01:45:00.296
Oh, my God.
I am moving to catering after this.

01:45:22.328 --> 01:45:23.659
My ass!

01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:28.231
My ass!

01:45:29.836 --> 01:45:33.101
Hey, yo!
We gotta get our shit together, tugg!

01:45:33.206 --> 01:45:35.436
We gotta get his cracker ass
to the chopper!

01:45:35.542 --> 01:45:39.842
Are you still crazy?
We gotta get candisky to the chopper!

01:45:39.946 --> 01:45:41.413
It's sandusky.

01:45:43.283 --> 01:45:46.582
- Kevin sandusky.
- That's my name.

01:45:46.686 --> 01:45:48.278
You remembered my name.

01:45:48.388 --> 01:45:50.413
Alpa, go help Cody.

01:45:50.523 --> 01:45:52.514
Portnoy, get sandusky
back to the chopper. Go!

01:45:52.625 --> 01:45:54.456
- I got him!
- Let's go!

01:45:55.895 --> 01:45:57.419
Let's get out of here!

01:46:09.309 --> 01:46:10.799
Hey, leaf!

01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:12.138
- Leaf!
- Yeah.

01:46:12.245 --> 01:46:13.245
Hit the plunger

01:46:13.346 --> 01:46:15.106
- as soon as they clear the bridge!
- Got it!

01:46:19.786 --> 01:46:22.220
Come on! Get in the chopper!

01:46:22.422 --> 01:46:25.220
- Come on! Move!
- Kirk! Wait!

01:46:29.763 --> 01:46:31.390
Laz, I'm gonna blow the bridge!

01:46:31.498 --> 01:46:33.295
Are you the special effects guy?

01:46:33.399 --> 01:46:35.526
- You God damn right I am.
- Fuck yeah!

01:46:35.935 --> 01:46:37.129
Leaf's about to blow the bridge.
Come on!

01:46:37.237 --> 01:46:39.831
You don't have to! You don't have to!
I'm staying.

01:46:39.939 --> 01:46:41.429
No, I can't let you do that, mate.
We gotta go.

01:46:41.541 --> 01:46:44.066
No, I'm telling you, I'm not being crazy.
They'll listen to me.

01:46:44.177 --> 01:46:46.668
I know it sounds weird,
but I have a connection with them.

01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:49.660
You're not doing tofu dinner theater
for these motherfuckers. Let's roll!

01:46:49.682 --> 01:46:53.516
- Get over here!
- I have a son now. Little half squat.

01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:55.178
Who in crikey fuck is half squat?

01:46:55.288 --> 01:46:57.518
He's my son. He's my boy!

01:46:57.624 --> 01:47:00.058
He needs me. I have to go back to him.

01:47:03.196 --> 01:47:04.857
You tell the world what happened here.

01:47:04.964 --> 01:47:06.795
What happened here?

01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:09.130
I don't know, but you need to tell them.

01:47:11.504 --> 01:47:13.335
I got this.

01:47:13.439 --> 01:47:14.599
Tugg!

01:47:15.308 --> 01:47:18.869
You take care of the boys!
I'll deal with these guys.

01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:23.875
Where is he going?
We're gonna fucking die!

01:47:23.983 --> 01:47:26.611
Laz, come on. He joined the circus.
Let's go.

01:47:26.719 --> 01:47:27.913
- You've got hands.
- Yeah.

01:47:28.021 --> 01:47:30.148
- Fuck! You've got hands?
- Come on!

01:47:31.224 --> 01:47:32.350
- Come on!
- Get in!

01:47:32.458 --> 01:47:34.085
- Come on!
- He's staying?

01:47:34.194 --> 01:47:36.458
Go! He's a lost cause, mate!
Get out of here!

01:47:41.034 --> 01:47:45.528
I was wrong! Blow the bridge!
Blow the fucking bridge!

01:47:51.377 --> 01:47:52.776
I got this.

01:47:53.446 --> 01:47:54.879
Leaf, no!

01:48:39.025 --> 01:48:41.653
It's over! He's gone!

01:48:41.761 --> 01:48:43.820
Cody! We gotta go!

01:48:45.832 --> 01:48:47.026
Look.

01:49:09.656 --> 01:49:10.987
Think he's done.

01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:12.318
Cover me!

01:49:13.393 --> 01:49:16.328
- Come on!
- Wait, come back!

01:49:16.429 --> 01:49:18.158
How do we cover him?

01:49:22.402 --> 01:49:25.803
All right, game over. Come on, mate.
Come on.

01:49:25.905 --> 01:49:28.499
- You all right, man?
- I'm cold.

01:49:28.608 --> 01:49:30.599
I can't feel my legs.

01:49:30.710 --> 01:49:33.645
No, no, they're in a puddle, mate. See?
There's a puddle right there.

01:49:33.746 --> 01:49:34.940
- No worries.
- Good.

01:49:35.048 --> 01:49:36.345
Come on, we gotta split, man.

01:49:36.449 --> 01:49:38.747
- You guys came back for me.
- Course.

01:49:38.851 --> 01:49:41.183
Hey! I want you to know something.

01:49:41.287 --> 01:49:42.481
What?

01:49:43.656 --> 01:49:45.453
I know who you are.

01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:49.323
You're my friend.

01:49:51.597 --> 01:49:53.224
You're my brother.

01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:56.933
But like a really cool brother, you know?

01:49:57.036 --> 01:49:58.401
Like a brother
where there was no animosity or...

01:49:58.504 --> 01:50:01.337
Don't look now,
you got some real tears going.

01:50:01.441 --> 01:50:02.441
Really?

01:50:02.542 --> 01:50:04.032
That's the stuff
that accolades are made of.

01:50:04.143 --> 01:50:05.610
Jesus, let's go, man!

01:50:05.712 --> 01:50:07.813
All right?

01:50:08.748 --> 01:50:10.181
Upsy-Daisy.

01:50:11.951 --> 01:50:14.943
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:50:17.090 --> 01:50:18.387
Get in! Get in!

01:50:18.491 --> 01:50:20.516
Come on! Here we go!

01:50:23.062 --> 01:50:25.860
Tuggernuts! I got it!

01:50:28.234 --> 01:50:30.532
- Tugger!
- Rick!

01:50:33.139 --> 01:50:34.367
What the fuck?

01:50:34.474 --> 01:50:36.101
I got the TiVo!

01:50:37.010 --> 01:50:41.413
My friend wants a TiVo,
my friend gets a TiVo!

01:50:46.586 --> 01:50:47.848
Oh, shit!

01:51:24.690 --> 01:51:26.715
And the Oscar goes to...

01:51:29.462 --> 01:51:31.760
Yes! Tugg speedman.

01:51:33.399 --> 01:51:36.095
"Tropic blunder,
the true story behind the making

01:51:36.202 --> 01:51:38.727
"of the most expensive
fake true war story ever."

01:51:40.306 --> 01:51:41.432
Yeah!

01:51:46.145 --> 01:51:48.045
Yeah, you son of a bitch!

01:52:07.366 --> 01:52:11.735
Eight oscars, $400 million

01:52:11.838 --> 01:52:15.069
and you saved
tugg speedman's career.

01:52:15.174 --> 01:52:18.041
I couldn't have done it
without you, slolom.

01:52:20.079 --> 01:52:21.171
Really?

01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:23.271
No, dickhead, of course I could.

01:52:23.382 --> 01:52:26.044
- A nutless monkey could do your job.
- Well, I...

01:52:26.152 --> 01:52:29.053
Now, go get drunk
and take credit at all the parties.

01:52:29.155 --> 01:52:31.851
- I would never do that to...
- Joking.

01:52:31.958 --> 01:52:33.323
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:52:33.426 --> 01:52:35.621
Very... okay, there he is.

01:52:35.728 --> 01:52:37.218
- There he is. Okay.
- Go have fun.

01:52:37.330 --> 01:52:38.854
All right. We're having a...

01:52:38.965 --> 01:52:41.445
Fuck, okay. Thank you, les.
Thank you. You have a good night...

01:52:41.467 --> 01:52:43.867
But seriously,
a nutless monkey could do your job.

01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:45.699
Good. Thank you, sir.
