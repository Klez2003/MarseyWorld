00:01:13.408 --> 00:01:15.994
There 's 100,000 streets in this city.

00:01:17.036 --> 00:01:19.456
You don't need to know the route.

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.125
You give me a time and a place,

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:24.544
I give you a five-minute window.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.923
Anything happens
in that five minutes and I'm yours.

00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:30.508
No matter what.

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:33.595
Anything happens a minute
either side of that

00:01:33.678 --> 00:01:35.597
and you're on your own.

00:01:36.347 --> 00:01:38.016
Do you understand?

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.854
Good.

00:01:45.857 --> 00:01:49.277
And you won't be able
to reach me on this phone again.

00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:23.269
Hey, there you are!

00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:25.271
She's down there.

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:27.649
Plain Jane Boring, just like you asked for,

00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:30.318
but I dropped in 300 horses on the inside,

00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:32.195
she is going to fly.

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:34.739
You look like a zombie, kid.

00:02:34.823 --> 00:02:36.616
You getting any sleep?

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:41.329
Can I offer you some
Benzedrine, Dexedrine, caffeine, nicotine?

00:02:41.412 --> 00:02:43.081
Oh, you don't smoke. That's right.

00:02:43.164 --> 00:02:44.582
Better Off.

00:02:45.917 --> 00:02:47.418
There she is!

00:02:48.628 --> 00:02:53.007
Chevy Impala, the most popular car
in the State of California.

00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:56.261
No one will be looking at you.

00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:05.496
...Robert Victor 3.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.167

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.934

00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:30.313
Reports of shots fired at Code

00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:44.911
Come on.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.373
Where the fuck is he? Come on.

00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:52.794
Unit 5, what's your 20?

00:04:52.877 --> 00:04:55.630
We are approximately two minutes
from that location.

00:05:03.388 --> 00:05:05.974
Come on, man. Where the hell are you?

00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:11.062
Come on!

00:05:13.022 --> 00:05:14.816
Come on!

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.735

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:19.779
- Come on, man.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

00:05:23.241 --> 00:05:24.617
All units be advised.

00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:26.160
Possible vehicle in question.

00:05:26.244 --> 00:05:28.246
Late model silver Impala.

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:59.485
1-Adam-3, South Bay at Seventh, clean

00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:03.448
Roger; 1-A dam-3.

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:07.118
Requesting air unit support.

00:06:19.964 --> 00:06:23.676
Unit 5 to Dispatch,
heading eastbound on Sixth.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.678
Copy that, Unit 5.

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:39.567
Base to Air 3.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.402
Any sign of that silver Impala?

00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:44.197
Air 3 to Base. Negative.

00:06:51.871 --> 00:06:54.832
Got a visual
heading west on Seventh Street bridge.

00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:00.838
Copy Air 3. All units, be advised...

00:07:25.905 --> 00:07:28.991
Base, Air 3 here.
We've lost visual on suspect.

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:43.089
Base to Air 3.
Possible gang shooting in progress.

00:07:43.214 --> 00:07:46.217
Proceed immediately
to Washington and La Brea.

00:07:46.634 --> 00:07:48.636
Roger; Dispatch. I'm out.

00:08:03.568 --> 00:08:05.653
All westbound units, be advised.

00:08:05.736 --> 00:08:08.990
Suspect last seen
near Seventh Street and Santa Fe.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.436
Dispatch, this is 1-Adam-6.

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:41.772
Possible suspect vehicle
sighted at stoplight.

00:08:42.023 --> 00:08:43.107
Stand by.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.860
Roger; Unit 6.

00:13:02.366 --> 00:13:04.493
- What floor?
- Fourth. Thanks.

00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:51.540
Hey, kid, you know what?

00:13:56.212 --> 00:13:57.546
Director wants to see a roll over.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.131
Are you okay with that?

00:13:59.215 --> 00:14:01.383
Remember, if you don't feel good,
just abort the shot.

00:14:01.467 --> 00:14:03.677
There's no shame in that, all right?

00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:05.387
I mean, you're...
You're doubling for the star.

00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:08.224
You're not like a day player or anything.

00:14:08.307 --> 00:14:10.809
And I got you 500 more, huh.

00:14:10.893 --> 00:14:12.520
Of course, we split that.

00:14:12.603 --> 00:14:14.355
You okay? Ready to go?

00:14:14.438 --> 00:14:16.565
All right. Counting on you!

00:14:31.247 --> 00:14:32.998
Excuse me, pal. I just need a minute here.

00:14:33.082 --> 00:14:36.752
Before I put you on camera,
I need you to sign this contract.

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:38.754
It just basically
releases liability to the company

00:14:38.837 --> 00:14:42.049
in case you die,
get maimed, or seriously injured.

00:14:42.675 --> 00:14:44.093
And action!

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:54.228
All right, that's a cut!

00:14:54.311 --> 00:14:55.938
Kid! That was fantastic!

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:57.731
Just fantastic.

00:14:57.815 --> 00:15:00.609
Okay. How you doing? You all right?

00:15:00.693 --> 00:15:02.403
You were good.
You were good. That was perfect.

00:15:58.751 --> 00:16:01.086
- You're a monkey.
- No, you're the monkey.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.338
- You're the monkey.
- You're the monkey.

00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:03.422
No, you're the monkey.

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:05.549
Hey, tell me one thing.

00:16:05.633 --> 00:16:07.676
- I love you.
- I love you.

00:17:02.815 --> 00:17:04.441
- Where should I put this?
- In the kitchen.

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:05.943
Thank you.

00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:09.947
Just be a second.

00:17:20.791 --> 00:17:21.959
Scary.

00:17:25.796 --> 00:17:27.798
Hey, you want a toothpick?

00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:36.223
You want a glass of water?

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:37.391
Okay.

00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:49.528
Thanks.

00:17:53.866 --> 00:17:55.868
So, you just moved to LA?

00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:59.538
No, I've been here for a while.

00:18:00.414 --> 00:18:02.207
You're just new here?

00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:10.966
That's Benicio's father.

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:14.303
Where is he?

00:18:15.304 --> 00:18:16.847
He's in prison.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.643
What do you do?

00:18:24.188 --> 00:18:25.439
I drive.

00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:29.359
Like a limo driver?

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.904
No, like, for movies.

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:37.576
You mean, all the car chases and stuff?

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:38.827
Yeah.

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:41.413
Is that dangerous?

00:18:51.215 --> 00:18:52.966
It's only part-time.

00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:56.136
Mostly I work at a garage.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.429
Where?

00:18:57.513 --> 00:18:59.139
Reseda Boulevard.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.316
I gotta go.

00:19:11.318 --> 00:19:12.402
Okay.

00:19:14.905 --> 00:19:16.365
Thanks for the water.

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:17.950
- Say bye.
- Bye.

00:19:56.655 --> 00:19:58.156
Mr. Rose, your food, sir.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.283
Okay.

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:02.494
Chicken chow mein and some Peking duck.

00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:04.788
Okay. Where are the chopsticks?

00:20:04.872 --> 00:20:07.291
Oh, you know. The guy just...

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:08.750
Go get them. Go get them.

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:11.837
I don't want that.
I don't want that. You eat it.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.381
Chopsticks and a fortune cookie.

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:16.383
Put out the fucking cigarette. I'm eating.

00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:18.343
Sorry.

00:20:19.261 --> 00:20:20.262
Whats the matter with you?

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:21.638
I'm just...

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.600
What happened to all the ashtrays
in this town?

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:26.476
You run a perfectly good business.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.437
I don't know why you want to change now.

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:31.773
You know how much
my business made last year?

00:20:31.857 --> 00:20:33.442
Thirty grand.

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:35.277
I can build a car in six months

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.196
and in six seconds,
these jerks write it off as a stunt

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.948
that won't even make it into the movie.

00:20:41.158 --> 00:20:44.411
See, all I need is a hard used stock car.

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:45.704
That's all.

00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:49.625
And I figure we start off with small town
circuit and we work our way up.

00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:52.753
And once we get to the show,
we're talking millions.

00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:54.129
- I have the chopsticks, sir.
- Yeah.

00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:55.505
Where's the cookies?

00:20:55.589 --> 00:20:58.383
- You know, I...
- Forget it. Forget it.

00:20:59.343 --> 00:21:01.720
So, you still haven't given me a number.

00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:03.138
All right.

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:05.515
$430,000.

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:08.894
Mr. Rose, I wouldn't come to you with this

00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:11.605
unless I was absolutely sure about it.

00:21:11.688 --> 00:21:13.649
How can you be sure, Shannon?

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:16.944
What do you got
that the big professional race teams don't?

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:20.405
I got the driver.

00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:23.116
You just told me they had
half a dozen drivers.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.576
Not like this one.

00:21:25.077 --> 00:21:26.912
This kid is special.

00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:28.288
I've been working with him for a while.

00:21:28.372 --> 00:21:30.499
I've never seen anything like it.

00:21:30.916 --> 00:21:32.459
If I had the money, I'd back him myself.

00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:35.003
Yeah, but you don't have the money.

00:21:36.046 --> 00:21:39.383
Mr. Rose, you put this
kid behind the wheel,

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:41.927
there's nothing he can't do.

00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:45.097
There's money here. You can't lose.

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:48.058
Fuck you eating chink food
in my fucking restaurant?

00:21:48.225 --> 00:21:50.769
What's a Jew doing running a pizzeria?

00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:53.230
You remember Shannon.

00:21:56.566 --> 00:21:59.611
Take a fucking hike.
I want to talk to my partner.

00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:04.282
I'm just fucking with you.

00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:07.327
How you doing, Shannon?
How's the fucking leg?

00:22:08.036 --> 00:22:09.579
I paid my debt.

00:22:11.248 --> 00:22:14.501
I'll think about it. Okay?

00:22:14.584 --> 00:22:16.378
But I want to meet the kid first.

00:22:17.004 --> 00:22:18.630
That's all I ask.

00:22:30.809 --> 00:22:33.437
Come on, I want you to meet somebody.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.522
And whatever you do like about the car,
don't say anything.

00:22:35.605 --> 00:22:37.899
I want to drive the price
down a little bit.

00:22:37.983 --> 00:22:40.736
Kid, I want you to meet Mr. Bernie Rose.

00:22:41.403 --> 00:22:43.280
Nice to meet YOU.

00:22:48.326 --> 00:22:50.495
My hands are a little dirty.

00:22:51.288 --> 00:22:52.706
So are mine.

00:22:57.085 --> 00:22:58.962
Good driving out there.

00:22:59.963 --> 00:23:01.173
Thanks.

00:23:03.633 --> 00:23:05.010
He's a good kid.

00:23:05.093 --> 00:23:07.637
So, what do you think? Do we get the 400?

00:23:09.014 --> 00:23:11.641
I'll give you 300 for 70%.

00:23:14.644 --> 00:23:15.729
Done.

00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:19.274
Right. Good.

00:23:20.692 --> 00:23:22.944
You won't be sorry.

00:23:28.408 --> 00:23:29.951
- I'm Shannon.
- Hi. Irene.

00:23:30.035 --> 00:23:31.578
Irene. How can I help you?

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:33.080
It just broke down.

00:23:33.163 --> 00:23:34.790
Just broke down. Just like that.

00:23:34.873 --> 00:23:36.208
- You want me to take a look at it?
- Yes, please.

00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:37.876
All right.

00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:39.920
We got all our bays full.

00:23:40.003 --> 00:23:42.672
Hey, pal, just drop it down here.
We'll push it in, all right?

00:23:42.923 --> 00:23:45.801
We want to push her into number three.

00:23:45.884 --> 00:23:48.428
- The car, not you.
- Good.

00:23:48.512 --> 00:23:50.055
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:23:51.765 --> 00:23:53.141
You two know each other?

00:23:53.225 --> 00:23:55.060
Don't.

00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:56.770
- Look at that.
- We're neighbors.

00:23:56.853 --> 00:23:59.856
Neighbors? Very good.
Well, we'll try to be neighborly too.

00:24:21.044 --> 00:24:22.295
You blinked.

00:24:22.796 --> 00:24:23.880
What?

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.551
- Can I call a cab from here?
- Yeah. Sure.

00:24:28.552 --> 00:24:29.803
What am I talking about?

00:24:30.971 --> 00:24:32.806
You and the kid are neighbors, right?

00:24:32.889 --> 00:24:34.599
- He can take you home.
- No.

00:24:34.683 --> 00:24:37.477
- I'd feel bad.
- No, no. Don't even think twice about it.

00:24:37.561 --> 00:24:40.772
He'd be happy to do it. He's a good guy.

00:24:41.982 --> 00:24:45.193
You know, he walked into my shop here
about five or six years ago.

00:24:46.069 --> 00:24:47.237
Right out of the blue.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.156
Asking for a job.

00:24:49.239 --> 00:24:52.659
So I put him to the test
to see what he could do.

00:24:52.742 --> 00:24:54.035
- The kid's amazing.
- Yeah.

00:24:54.494 --> 00:24:56.288
So, I hire him on the spot.

00:24:57.914 --> 00:25:00.167
At about half the wages I normally pay.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.459
He didn't blink an eye.

00:25:02.294 --> 00:25:05.630
Hey, kid,
come over here for a second, will you?

00:25:05.714 --> 00:25:08.967
And I have been exploiting him ever since.

00:25:10.886 --> 00:25:12.345
Don't tell him.

00:25:12.929 --> 00:25:15.932
Looks like we have
a bigger problem than I thought.

00:25:16.016 --> 00:25:19.269
And we're going to have
to keep the car here for a few days.

00:25:19.352 --> 00:25:23.231
So I offered your services
to take Benicio and Irene home.

00:25:23.315 --> 00:25:24.774
That be okay?

00:25:27.611 --> 00:25:28.945
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

00:25:31.781 --> 00:25:34.784
I don't have wheels on my car.

00:25:35.035 --> 00:25:36.203
Okay.

00:25:36.286 --> 00:25:38.205
It's one thing you should know about me.

00:25:38.288 --> 00:25:39.289
Well, put the tires on.

00:25:39.372 --> 00:25:41.625
- You got five minutes?
- Yeah.

00:26:04.606 --> 00:26:06.066
Hey, do you want to see something?

00:26:09.653 --> 00:26:10.779
Yeah.

00:26:14.282 --> 00:26:15.367
Okay.

00:28:11.191 --> 00:28:13.443
That was good.

00:28:13.526 --> 00:28:15.278
He had a good time.

00:28:23.787 --> 00:28:24.996
Me 1200.

00:28:32.087 --> 00:28:35.006
Sorry if I put you
on the spot showing up like that.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:36.424
It's okay.

00:29:00.281 --> 00:29:02.826
I'm not doing anything this weekend.

00:29:07.122 --> 00:29:09.457
If you want a ride or something.

00:30:43.927 --> 00:30:46.638
Don't worry about her bumps and bruises,
that's just fiberglass.

00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:48.097
That's easily replaceable.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.351
Put a coat of paint on there,
some sponsor decals.

00:30:51.434 --> 00:30:53.686
Look at the tread
on the tire's still good, huh?

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:55.355
We're in business.

00:30:56.022 --> 00:30:58.858
We paid 300 fucking grand
for this piece of shit?

00:30:58.942 --> 00:31:02.028
I paid for it. Out of my own pocket.

00:31:02.111 --> 00:31:03.655
This is just the shell.

00:31:03.905 --> 00:31:06.115
It's the inside that
counts, not the outside.

00:31:06.199 --> 00:31:07.742
- Right, Shannon?
- You are correct, sir.

00:31:07.825 --> 00:31:11.204
Fuck that shit. I pay 300 for something,
I want everybody to fucking see it.

00:31:11.287 --> 00:31:13.748
Of course you do.

00:31:13.831 --> 00:31:15.208
Now, this.

00:31:15.375 --> 00:31:19.671
That is one motherfucking
fine-ass pussy mobile, motherfucker.

00:31:20.129 --> 00:31:21.214
Damn!

00:31:21.881 --> 00:31:23.675
Shannon, sell him the car.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.554
He wouldn't be able
to find pussy in a whorehouse.

00:31:27.637 --> 00:31:31.474
You Know what?
This oar will even make you good looking.

00:31:31.641 --> 00:31:32.934
I'm already good looking, pal.

00:31:33.017 --> 00:31:34.227
How's it going?

00:31:37.647 --> 00:31:39.524
When's our first race?

00:31:41.276 --> 00:31:42.860
Pretty soon.

00:31:43.903 --> 00:31:45.530
You gonna be ready?

00:31:47.282 --> 00:31:48.616
I hope so.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.952
"I hope so."

00:31:51.035 --> 00:31:54.330
Hey, no false modesty.
I got a lot of money in this.

00:31:56.082 --> 00:31:58.459
Did Shannon ever tell you now we met?

00:32:00.086 --> 00:32:01.170
No.

00:32:01.254 --> 00:32:03.006
I used to produce movies.

00:32:03.089 --> 00:32:04.507
In the '8Os.

00:32:04.591 --> 00:32:07.760
Kind of like action films. Sexy stuff.

00:32:07.844 --> 00:32:09.929
One critic called them European.

00:32:10.013 --> 00:32:12.140
I thought they were shit.

00:32:12.223 --> 00:32:15.977
Anyway, he arranged all the cars for me.
Did all the stunts.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.021
I liked him. I liked having him around.

00:32:18.146 --> 00:32:20.523
Even though
he overcharged the shit out of me.

00:32:22.108 --> 00:32:23.985
His next business venture,

00:32:24.068 --> 00:32:26.613
he got involved with
some of Nine's friends.

00:32:26.696 --> 00:32:29.073
They didn't go for the overcharging bit.

00:32:29.157 --> 00:32:31.367
They broke his pelvis.

00:32:31.451 --> 00:32:33.453
He's never had a lot of luck.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.706
The reason I'm telling you this

00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:39.500
is that he has a lot invested in you.

00:32:39.584 --> 00:32:41.794
And so do I.

00:32:41.878 --> 00:32:44.339
So anything you need, you call me.

00:32:45.173 --> 00:32:46.883
We're a team now.

00:32:49.385 --> 00:32:50.928
I'm excited.

00:32:51.012 --> 00:32:53.723
Nino, let's get the fuck out of here.

00:33:09.572 --> 00:33:11.741
- Is he a bad guy?
- Yeah.

00:33:12.617 --> 00:33:14.786
How can you tell?

00:33:14.869 --> 00:33:17.872
Because he's a shark.

00:33:18.915 --> 00:33:20.291
There's no good sharks?

00:33:20.375 --> 00:33:23.294
No. I mean, just look at him.

00:33:24.504 --> 00:33:27.048
Does he look like a good guy to you?

00:33:28.424 --> 00:33:29.592
- Hi.
- How are you?

00:33:29.717 --> 00:33:31.719
- Good. How are you?
- Good.

00:33:36.391 --> 00:33:37.892
This is Cindy.

00:33:39.602 --> 00:33:40.687
Hi.

00:34:19.475 --> 00:34:21.686
That was my husband's lawyer.

00:34:22.645 --> 00:34:24.731
He's coming home in a week.

00:35:48.272 --> 00:35:54.111
We're here celebrating,
but it's a shameful thing what I did.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.076
And I have a lot of making up to do
to everyone.

00:36:06.082 --> 00:36:08.876
But second chances are rare.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.127
Right?

00:36:11.295 --> 00:36:13.840
And that's worth celebrating. Right?

00:36:16.008 --> 00:36:20.346
So I want to make a toast
to that lady right there.

00:36:21.764 --> 00:36:23.516
Thanks for staying.

00:36:23.975 --> 00:36:25.643
CD:3
?5.

00:37:41.594 --> 00:37:42.678
Hey.

00:37:44.639 --> 00:37:45.681
Hi.

00:37:53.648 --> 00:37:55.524
Sorry about the noise.

00:37:59.195 --> 00:38:01.405
I was going to call the cops.

00:38:03.699 --> 00:38:05.368
I wish you would.

00:38:08.913 --> 00:38:09.914
You're getting heavier.

00:38:12.083 --> 00:38:13.417
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:38:15.878 --> 00:38:17.213
Hey.

00:38:19.382 --> 00:38:20.883
How you doing?

00:38:21.258 --> 00:38:24.470
- Hi.
- This guy's been telling me a lot about you.

00:38:25.388 --> 00:38:28.432
Says you been coming around,
helping out a lot.

00:38:29.141 --> 00:38:31.811
Yeah? Helping out? Is that right?

00:38:33.354 --> 00:38:34.855
Is that right?

00:38:38.067 --> 00:38:41.070
That's very nice.
That's nice of you. Thank you.

00:38:41.153 --> 00:38:42.697
You're welcome.

00:38:46.075 --> 00:38:48.035
You drive for the movies?

00:38:49.078 --> 00:38:50.204
Yeah.

00:38:51.789 --> 00:38:54.500
- I can take that.
- No, no, no. I got it.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.672
Let Mommy talk to her friend.

00:39:01.215 --> 00:39:02.425
Come on.

00:39:21.318 --> 00:39:22.820
Have a good night.

00:40:00.316 --> 00:40:02.526
You're Shannon's buddy, right?

00:40:04.653 --> 00:40:06.322
We met last year.

00:40:07.823 --> 00:40:11.118
You drove me
and my brother back from Palm Springs.

00:40:14.497 --> 00:40:16.540
We hired another wheelman.

00:40:16.624 --> 00:40:20.461
I spent six months in jail.
My brother, he got himself Killed.

00:40:24.882 --> 00:40:26.008
I got this sweet job coming up.

00:40:26.092 --> 00:40:27.927
How about this?

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:29.762
You shut your mouth.

00:40:29.845 --> 00:40:33.933
Or I'll kick your teeth down your throat
and I'll shut it for you.

00:40:41.023 --> 00:40:42.900
Nice seeing you again.

00:41:59.435 --> 00:42:01.645
Come on, it's okay.

00:42:01.729 --> 00:42:05.608
Come here. Don't be scared.

00:42:09.403 --> 00:42:11.280
Don't tell Mommy, okay?

00:42:13.616 --> 00:42:16.243
Okay? It's a secret between the boys.

00:42:18.662 --> 00:42:19.914
Fuck me.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.392
Who were they?

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:25.896
What the fuck are you going to do?
You're gonna go beat them up for me?

00:43:26.188 --> 00:43:27.731
Huh, stunt guy?

00:43:28.691 --> 00:43:31.694
Why the fuck do you want to know
who they are?

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.666
There are some guys
that want me to do a job for them

00:43:45.749 --> 00:43:47.835
and I'm not going to do it.

00:43:48.877 --> 00:43:50.629
That's who they are.

00:43:51.839 --> 00:43:53.382
What's the job?

00:43:54.717 --> 00:43:57.636
They want me
to rob a pawnshop in the Valley.

00:43:59.346 --> 00:44:00.764
Why?

00:44:00.848 --> 00:44:03.892
'Cause I owe them some protection money
from when I was inside.

00:44:03.976 --> 00:44:05.602
It's 2,000 bucks.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.398
But as soon as I got out, it's 5,000 bucks.

00:44:09.481 --> 00:44:12.276
No, actually, it's $10,000. $20,000.

00:44:12.359 --> 00:44:15.738
Tomorrow I don't know
what the fuck it's going to be.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.950
What are you going to do?

00:44:20.034 --> 00:44:22.077
That's a really good question.

00:44:24.997 --> 00:44:28.917
They said they were going
to come after Benicio and Irene next.

00:44:50.606 --> 00:44:51.857
You okay?

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:55.778
You want something to drink?

00:44:59.406 --> 00:45:01.408
What is it you got there?

00:45:03.911 --> 00:45:05.245
Can I see?

00:45:18.675 --> 00:45:20.969
One of those men gave you that?

00:45:22.805 --> 00:45:24.973
They told me not to lose it.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.897
You want me to keep that for you?

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.107
Okay.

00:45:58.382 --> 00:45:59.842
How's Benice?

00:46:00.759 --> 00:46:01.844
Good.

00:46:05.514 --> 00:46:07.015
You just saying that?

00:46:07.099 --> 00:46:08.308
No.

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:12.896
What do you mean?

00:46:15.649 --> 00:46:19.987
I saw that Standard was in an accident.

00:46:21.113 --> 00:46:22.197
Yeah.

00:46:25.868 --> 00:46:27.369
What happened?

00:46:31.373 --> 00:46:32.875
He got beat up.

00:46:37.087 --> 00:46:38.172
Why?

00:46:39.715 --> 00:46:41.300
Just drunk kids.

00:46:53.562 --> 00:46:55.397
You should come over.

00:46:58.066 --> 00:47:00.194
You should come and see him.

00:47:06.992 --> 00:47:09.703
You want to... You want to hear a story?

00:47:09.786 --> 00:47:11.497
Do you want to hear
how Mommy and me met?

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.333
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

00:47:16.251 --> 00:47:20.130
We were at a party.
And she was 19 years old.

00:47:20.214 --> 00:47:21.340
Seventeen.

00:47:21.423 --> 00:47:22.674
- You weren't 17.
- I was.

00:47:23.258 --> 00:47:25.135
- Wow. So it was illegal?
- Yeah.

00:47:27.679 --> 00:47:32.851
All right. So I illegally walked
over to a 17-year-old girl.

00:47:33.268 --> 00:47:36.271
And I walk up and I say, “Hello, Miss.

00:47:37.439 --> 00:47:39.650
"What is your name?"

00:47:39.733 --> 00:47:42.361
And she didn't say anything.
And then I said...

00:47:42.444 --> 00:47:44.947
“Well, my name is Standard Gabriel.”

00:47:46.114 --> 00:47:47.282
Then what did you say?

00:47:52.788 --> 00:47:54.456
I said...

00:47:55.499 --> 00:47:57.751
"Where is the deluxe version?"

00:48:03.215 --> 00:48:05.092
She's good, man.

00:48:05.676 --> 00:48:07.511
Sharp.

00:48:07.594 --> 00:48:09.805
Man. It killed me.

00:48:13.433 --> 00:48:15.769
And then a year later, you popped out, man.

00:48:21.984 --> 00:48:24.278
It was the best day of my life.

00:49:08.864 --> 00:49:10.907
If I drive for you, you get your money.

00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:13.118
You tell me where we start,
where we're going,

00:49:13.201 --> 00:49:14.494
where we're going afterwards.

00:49:14.578 --> 00:49:17.331
I give you five minutes when we get there.

00:49:17.414 --> 00:49:19.583
Anything happens in that five minutes,
and I'm yours.

00:49:19.666 --> 00:49:20.959
No matter what.

00:49:21.043 --> 00:49:24.171
Anything a minute on either side of that
and you're on your own.

00:49:24.254 --> 00:49:26.423
I don't sit in while
you're running it down.

00:49:26.548 --> 00:49:28.300
I don't carry a gun.

00:49:28.383 --> 00:49:29.635
I drive.

00:49:30.636 --> 00:49:32.554
You look like you're hard to work with.

00:49:33.722 --> 00:49:36.099
Not if we understand each other.

00:49:36.725 --> 00:49:38.018
What's to understand?

00:49:38.685 --> 00:49:40.270
I can't do this thing alone.

00:49:40.395 --> 00:49:42.981
- You got Blanche.
- Come on, man.

00:49:45.108 --> 00:49:47.319
She's beautiful. Look at her.

00:49:49.363 --> 00:49:52.240
What the fuck you rolling your eyes at for?

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:55.243
You know what, get the fuck out of here.

00:49:55.327 --> 00:49:59.414
Get up! Standard, take her
with you and go get her a fucking Coke!

00:50:06.088 --> 00:50:08.090
Okay, here's the deal.

00:50:09.675 --> 00:50:11.593
This much for Blanche,

00:50:13.095 --> 00:50:16.098
this much for that asshole,
minus what he owes me,

00:50:17.599 --> 00:50:19.935
and this much for you.

00:50:23.772 --> 00:50:25.565
You still interested?

00:50:27.818 --> 00:50:30.112
Good. Anything else?

00:50:31.446 --> 00:50:34.241
When you get your money, his debt's paid.

00:50:35.283 --> 00:50:36.910
He's out for good.

00:50:36.993 --> 00:50:39.705
And you never go near his family again.

00:50:40.372 --> 00:50:41.915
You understand?

00:50:46.461 --> 00:50:47.796
I'm here with my family.

00:50:48.797 --> 00:50:50.006
And my new friend.

00:50:51.174 --> 00:50:52.384
And...

00:50:53.635 --> 00:50:55.429
Toast to the future.

00:50:57.806 --> 00:50:59.307
To our future.

00:51:19.119 --> 00:51:20.162
Hey.

00:51:23.915 --> 00:51:26.126
I'll see you in five minutes.

00:51:32.007 --> 00:51:33.383
I'll see you in four.

00:54:01.448 --> 00:54:02.574
Oh, my...

00:54:38.318 --> 00:54:39.402
Shit!

00:54:41.404 --> 00:54:42.447
Oh, my God!

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:15.457
How much did Cook say
we were going to get?

00:56:18.626 --> 00:56:20.003
Forty grand.

00:56:28.595 --> 00:56:29.929
Stay here.

00:56:49.365 --> 00:56:52.285
When was
the last time you saw your husband?

00:56:55.163 --> 00:56:57.290
Can you answer the question?

00:56:59.292 --> 00:57:00.460
Ma'am.

00:57:06.925 --> 00:57:08.051
Hello?

00:57:08.134 --> 00:57:10.136
Benicio? Is that you?

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:11.471
Yeah.

00:57:11.554 --> 00:57:14.432
I Hey.
- Hi.

00:57:14.516 --> 00:57:16.518
Is your mother there?

00:57:16.601 --> 00:57:20.688
She's sitting down talking to the police.

00:57:21.856 --> 00:57:24.818
Okay, just tell her
I'm going to call her back, okay?

00:57:24.901 --> 00:57:26.361
Okay, bye.

00:57:29.614 --> 00:57:32.659
In related news,
an attempted robbery turned tragic today

00:57:32.742 --> 00:57:35.995
when the owner of a local pawnshop
opened fire on an intruder.

00:57:36.246 --> 00:57:38.623
The armed robber
was pronounced dead at the scene.

00:57:38.706 --> 00:57:42.961
He has been identified as Standard Gabriel
of Echo Park, Los Angeles.

00:57:43.044 --> 00:57:45.547
Other details are unclean
but the owner of the pawnshop

00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:48.216
told reporters that Gabriel acted alone

00:57:48.299 --> 00:57:50.093
and that no money had been stolen.

00:57:50.969 --> 00:57:54.639
In other news,
four high school athletes were arrested...

00:58:14.075 --> 00:58:16.744
If he saw you take the money

00:58:17.162 --> 00:58:19.414
and he saw you get in the car,

00:58:21.499 --> 00:58:23.501
then why didn't he say anything?

00:58:25.461 --> 00:58:27.005
I have no idea.

00:58:38.558 --> 00:58:41.561
Did you have any idea
there'd be a second car?

00:58:46.441 --> 00:58:48.651
I already told you everything.

00:58:54.282 --> 00:58:57.869
Now, you just got a little
boy's father killed.

00:58:57.952 --> 00:59:00.622
And you almost got us killed.

00:59:00.705 --> 00:59:02.373
And now you're lying to me.

00:59:03.416 --> 00:59:05.710
So, how about this?

00:59:05.793 --> 00:59:10.256
From now on,
every word out of your mouth is the truth.

00:59:12.258 --> 00:59:14.260
Or I'm going to hurt you.

00:59:15.595 --> 00:59:17.263
Do you understand?

00:59:18.473 --> 00:59:20.600
Now what did Cook tell you?

00:59:21.768 --> 00:59:24.562
He said there'd be another
car to hold us up,

00:59:24.646 --> 00:59:26.564
but he didn't say anything
about all this money.

00:59:26.648 --> 00:59:29.901
He didn't say anything
about anyone getting killed.

00:59:30.985 --> 00:59:33.029
You were going to rip us off?

00:59:39.535 --> 00:59:41.329
What's his real name?

00:59:41.955 --> 00:59:44.374
He says it's Chris, but
I just call him Cook.

00:59:49.254 --> 00:59:52.715
You're going to take me to him right now.

00:59:54.801 --> 00:59:56.469
Do you understand?

00:59:56.719 --> 00:59:58.096
Yes.

01:02:54.522 --> 01:02:55.857
Easy. Easy.

01:03:10.371 --> 01:03:12.623
What did you do with the cash?

01:03:15.042 --> 01:03:16.335
'Cause I could keep it safe for you...

01:03:16.419 --> 01:03:18.296
Will you just stop it?

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:27.221
This guy Cook, does he have a real name?

01:03:28.389 --> 01:03:29.557
Chris.

01:03:31.434 --> 01:03:32.602
Maybe.

01:03:34.937 --> 01:03:37.690
I'll ask Bernie. See if he knows him.

01:03:39.984 --> 01:03:41.486
Jesus, I can't..

01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:44.280
I can't stop thinking
about what we could do with all that dough.

01:03:44.363 --> 01:03:46.532
- Will you just stop?
- All right.

01:03:46.616 --> 01:03:48.701
A lot of guys mess around
with married women,

01:03:48.784 --> 01:03:50.870
but you're the only one I know
who robs a joint

01:03:50.953 --> 01:03:53.289
just to pay back the husband.

01:03:53.372 --> 01:03:55.124
Crazy.

01:03:55.208 --> 01:03:58.085
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

01:04:29.867 --> 01:04:31.160
Where's Cook?

01:04:31.285 --> 01:04:33.746
He's in the dressing room.

01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:35.998
Where's that?

01:04:36.082 --> 01:04:37.667
It's over there.

01:05:07.488 --> 01:05:09.365
Whose money do I have?

01:05:10.658 --> 01:05:12.868
Don't worry. They're going to come get it.

01:05:13.202 --> 01:05:14.745
No! No!

01:05:15.538 --> 01:05:16.956
Call them.

01:05:17.039 --> 01:05:18.791
Somebody call Nino!

01:05:30.261 --> 01:05:32.054
Do you remember this?

01:05:55.911 --> 01:05:57.079
Hello.

01:05:58.331 --> 01:05:59.457
Nino?

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.751
No, sorry, pal.
Why don't you call back later?

01:06:01.834 --> 01:06:03.210
We 're closed.

01:06:03.294 --> 01:06:07.214
I could, but I think Nino would be upset
that you made him wait.

01:06:07.298 --> 01:06:10.009
Can I ask what this is about?

01:06:10.092 --> 01:06:12.053
I have something of his.

01:06:12.887 --> 01:06:14.180
And that would be?

01:06:15.431 --> 01:06:17.099
A million dollars.

01:06:18.351 --> 01:06:19.727
Please hold.

01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:29.487
You got something
that fucking belongs to me?

01:06:34.825 --> 01:06:36.827
It seems that way.

01:06:38.954 --> 01:06:40.831
And you're calling me?

01:06:42.083 --> 01:06:43.125
Why?

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:47.129
You expect me
to buy my own shit back from you?

01:06:47.213 --> 01:06:49.131
I'm not selling it.

01:06:49.423 --> 01:06:53.302
I'm going to give you a time and a place
and you're going to come and get it.

01:06:53.386 --> 01:06:55.054
Do you understand?

01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:59.433
And what do you get out of it?

01:06:59.517 --> 01:07:00.851
Just that.

01:07:01.769 --> 01:07:03.104
Out of it.

01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:06.857
And your partners are happy with that?

01:07:08.275 --> 01:07:10.236
I don't have any partners.

01:07:11.112 --> 01:07:14.782
You discuss this with anybody else?

01:07:16.283 --> 01:07:17.785
No, just you.

01:07:19.328 --> 01:07:21.956
You're not very good at this, are you?

01:07:33.467 --> 01:07:36.053
Go check out who this fucking guy is.

01:08:14.759 --> 01:08:17.762
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:08:17.845 --> 01:08:19.847
Can't talk. I have to go.

01:08:23.058 --> 01:08:25.436
Can I just walk with you for a...

01:08:25.519 --> 01:08:26.812
Yeah.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.709
I have to tell you something.

01:08:54.673 --> 01:09:00.721
Standard was into some guys in prison
for a lot of money.

01:09:03.682 --> 01:09:07.645
And they were going to hurt you
and Benicio if he didn't pay it.

01:09:10.231 --> 01:09:12.483
He asked me for my help.

01:09:15.653 --> 01:09:17.530
Everything went wrong.

01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:22.785
I'm sorry.

01:09:28.123 --> 01:09:30.000
I still got the money.

01:09:33.921 --> 01:09:36.298
You can have it if you wanted to.

01:09:38.759 --> 01:09:40.678
You can take Benicio...

01:09:52.314 --> 01:09:55.776
I just thought you could get out of here
if you wanted.

01:09:58.445 --> 01:10:00.322
I could come with you.

01:10:04.368 --> 01:10:06.370
I could look out for you.

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:14.211
Sorry. Wrong floor.

01:13:37.873 --> 01:13:40.375
They came to my apartment, Shannon.

01:13:41.502 --> 01:13:43.045
How'd they know where I live?

01:13:45.339 --> 01:13:46.924
I told you. I was going to call Bernie.

01:13:47.007 --> 01:13:49.551
I just wanted him to know that...
That it wasn't about...

01:13:49.676 --> 01:13:52.471
That you're not interested in the money.
That you just did it for the girl.

01:13:58.852 --> 01:14:00.437
- I just...
- Why did you have to fucking tell them

01:14:00.521 --> 01:14:01.563
about Irene?

01:14:01.647 --> 01:14:03.816
- Calm down!
- You told them about Irene!

01:14:03.899 --> 01:14:05.651
Calm down, kid. Just calm down.

01:14:05.734 --> 01:14:07.820
I should fucking kill you!

01:14:07.903 --> 01:14:09.196
You told them about Irene.

01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:11.865
I just wanted him to know

01:14:12.407 --> 01:14:14.785
that as soon as you returned the money
that was the end of it.

01:14:14.868 --> 01:14:16.787
That's all. I didn't know...

01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:20.582
How was I supposed to know?
How was I supposed to know that? Okay?

01:14:20.666 --> 01:14:23.377
Look, let me just talk to Bernie. Okay.

01:14:24.044 --> 01:14:26.713
Why you got to fuck
everything up, Shannon?

01:14:26.797 --> 01:14:30.008
How was I supposed to know
everything led to Nino?

01:14:36.014 --> 01:14:37.474
They're gonna come looking for me.

01:14:37.558 --> 01:14:39.518
And they're going to come for you.

01:14:39.601 --> 01:14:41.979
Do you understand?

01:14:42.062 --> 01:14:45.566
You got to get out of here.
And you got to get out now.

01:14:45.649 --> 01:14:46.984
- Listen to me.
- Oh, God.

01:14:47.067 --> 01:14:48.944
Listen to me, Shannon.

01:14:49.027 --> 01:14:50.612
Listen.

01:14:50.696 --> 01:14:54.449
You get out of here
and you never fucking come back.

01:14:54.533 --> 01:14:56.285
You never come back.

01:15:02.249 --> 01:15:04.251
What are you going to do?

01:15:21.101 --> 01:15:23.896
I already gave you my advice.

01:15:23.979 --> 01:15:26.607
You should have taken the money
and left the guy alone.

01:15:26.690 --> 01:15:27.900
It's not that simple, Bernie.

01:15:27.983 --> 01:15:31.153
No, of course not.
Now that it's bounced up in your face.

01:15:31.236 --> 01:15:32.321
Nino, I owe you this guy.

01:15:32.404 --> 01:15:34.198
Just give me a little time
and I'll get rid of him.

01:15:34.281 --> 01:15:36.825
Shut the fuck up,

01:15:36.909 --> 01:15:39.077
you fucking monkey.

01:15:39.161 --> 01:15:42.873
The money belongs
to some half-assed wise guy out of Philly.

01:15:42.956 --> 01:15:44.666
Now, I got tipped off,

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:47.127
he was stashing
a million bucks in a pawnshop.

01:15:47.211 --> 01:15:48.879
He was going to invest it here in LA.

01:15:48.962 --> 01:15:50.672
He was going to set up a rival operation.

01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:53.717
So you stole from the East Coast mob?

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:56.929
No. I stole from some jumped-up punk

01:15:57.012 --> 01:15:58.722
who was trying to step on our action.

01:15:58.805 --> 01:16:03.310
Yeah? Then why didn't you come to me
before you set up this dummy robbery?

01:16:04.561 --> 01:16:06.521
Before you hire this piece of shit.

01:16:06.605 --> 01:16:08.232
This is something off to the side, Bernie.

01:16:08.315 --> 01:16:09.858
I didn't want to involve you in this.

01:16:09.942 --> 01:16:11.818
Well, I'm involved now!

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.530
I'm going to tell you something.

01:16:15.614 --> 01:16:17.449
Anybody...

01:16:17.532 --> 01:16:21.453
Anybody finds out you
stole from the family,

01:16:21.536 --> 01:16:23.038
we're both dead.

01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:24.873
What fucking family?

01:16:25.832 --> 01:16:29.586
The family who still
calls me a fucking kike!

01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:31.338
To my face!

01:16:32.464 --> 01:16:34.591
Yeah, I'm 59 years old, Bernie.

01:16:34.675 --> 01:16:37.344
They still pinch my cheek
like I'm some fucking kid.

01:16:39.179 --> 01:16:40.430
Family.

01:16:40.514 --> 01:16:43.267
The money always flows up, Izzy.

01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:44.851
You know that.

01:16:46.395 --> 01:16:49.940
That's why this driver's gotta go, Bernie.

01:16:50.023 --> 01:16:52.943
He's gotta go. And your pal, Shannon.

01:16:53.026 --> 01:16:56.738
These are the only two guys
who can tie me to this robbery.

01:17:36.570 --> 01:17:39.281
Now it's your turn to clean up after me.

01:18:42.803 --> 01:18:44.971
All these priceless cars.

01:18:45.055 --> 01:18:47.808
One would think you'd have better locks.

01:18:49.643 --> 01:18:51.269
Why?

01:18:51.353 --> 01:18:53.563
Door's always open to you.

01:18:53.647 --> 01:18:54.898
Going somewhere?

01:19:00.529 --> 01:19:01.905
Thinking about it.

01:19:03.156 --> 01:19:05.033
I'm looking for your driver.

01:19:07.411 --> 01:19:09.955
You break in here, I figure it's bad news.

01:19:10.288 --> 01:19:14.042
No, Shannon. It's bad luck.

01:19:14.126 --> 01:19:17.796
2,000 heists a year in this city,

01:19:17.879 --> 01:19:19.756
he has to pick the wrong one.

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:21.925
He tried to put it right.

01:19:22.008 --> 01:19:24.678
Well, he picked the wrong
guy for that, too.

01:19:24.761 --> 01:19:28.890
My partner is a belligerent asshole
with his back against the wall.

01:19:29.516 --> 01:19:31.268
Right now, so am I.

01:19:32.227 --> 01:19:35.439
If I don't set this straight,
I'm in big trouble.

01:19:38.608 --> 01:19:40.735
Any idea where he might be?

01:19:43.321 --> 01:19:44.531
Mexico.

01:19:45.699 --> 01:19:48.285
Or maybe it was Belize.

01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:52.956
Really?

01:19:59.546 --> 01:20:02.674
I was getting excited
about this whole thing.

01:20:02.757 --> 01:20:05.177
My name on a car!

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.554
I mean, look how beautiful.

01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:10.891
I wanted to see my name on this thing.

01:20:13.101 --> 01:20:16.313
I think we would have made a go
at this business.

01:20:31.244 --> 01:20:33.955
Don't worry. Don't worry. That's it.

01:20:34.039 --> 01:20:35.248
It's done.

01:20:36.041 --> 01:20:38.376
There's no pain. It's over. It's over.

01:25:16.488 --> 01:25:18.406
What the fuck was that?

01:25:51.064 --> 01:25:52.357
Let's get out of here.

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.067
Yeah.

01:27:55.647 --> 01:27:56.814
Hello?

01:27:58.024 --> 01:28:01.319
You know
the story about the scorpion and the frog?

01:28:04.197 --> 01:28:07.367
Your friend Nino
didn't make it across the river.

01:28:09.619 --> 01:28:12.205
I think this has gone on long enough.

01:28:13.581 --> 01:28:16.209
You see any reason for it to continue?

01:28:18.002 --> 01:28:20.004
What do you say we meet?

01:28:22.507 --> 01:28:23.967
Why?

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:30.473
Well, you, me, and your girlfriend
are the only players left.

01:28:31.474 --> 01:28:32.725
How's that for a reason?

01:28:35.561 --> 01:28:36.896
When?

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:38.815
Tomorrow.

01:28:38.898 --> 01:28:40.692
There's a place on Sherman Way

01:28:40.775 --> 01:28:43.152
it's a restaurant called The Great Wall.

01:28:43.236 --> 01:28:44.779
Do you know it?

01:29:13.057 --> 01:29:14.976
Can I talk to you?

01:29:17.603 --> 01:29:19.480
I won't keep you long.

01:29:24.235 --> 01:29:27.822
I have to go somewhere
and I don't think I can come back.

01:29:32.285 --> 01:29:34.954
But I just want you to know.

01:29:35.038 --> 01:29:37.749
Getting to be around you and Benicio

01:29:39.959 --> 01:29:42.879
was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

01:30:34.806 --> 01:30:36.766
Did you bring the money?

01:30:42.730 --> 01:30:45.441
Here's what I'm prepared to offer.

01:30:45.525 --> 01:30:48.611
You give me the money, the girl is safe.

01:30:48.694 --> 01:30:50.571
Forever. Nobody knows about her.

01:30:50.655 --> 01:30:52.365
She's off the map.

01:30:54.075 --> 01:30:56.327
I can't offer you the same.

01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:00.039
So, this is what I would suggest.

01:31:00.706 --> 01:31:03.584
We conclude our deal. We'll shake hands.

01:31:03.668 --> 01:31:06.003
You start the rest of your life.

01:31:08.714 --> 01:31:11.300
Any dreams you have, or plans,

01:31:11.384 --> 01:31:13.386
or hopes for your future...

01:31:13.469 --> 01:31:16.889
I think you're going to
have to put that on hold.

01:31:16.973 --> 01:31:19.934
For the rest of your life you're going to
be looking over your shoulder.

01:31:20.017 --> 01:31:23.980
I'm just telling you this
because I want you to know the truth.

01:31:25.565 --> 01:31:27.400
But the girl is safe.

01:31:47.545 --> 01:31:49.422
Where's the money now?

01:31:50.965 --> 01:31:52.592
It's in the car.

01:32:00.975 --> 01:32:02.226
Come on.

01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:24.226

You don't want to bring
them down on us, do ya?

01:41:26.862 --> 01:41:28.655
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

01:41:29.448 --> 01:41:31.325
She was singing about pirates!

01:41:31.367 --> 01:41:33.492
Bad luck to be singing about pirates

01:41:33.577 --> 01:41:36.747
with us mired in this unnatural fog,
mark my words.

01:41:36.831 --> 01:41:38.165
Consider them marked.

01:41:39.918 --> 01:41:42.335
- On your way.
- Aye, lieutenant.

01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:44.504
It's bad luck to have
a woman on board too.

01:41:44.547 --> 01:41:46.797
Even a miniature one.

01:41:47.924 --> 01:41:50.384
I think it'd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

01:41:52.096 --> 01:41:54.181
Think again, Miss Swann.

01:41:54.265 --> 01:41:57.100
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of 'em.

01:41:57.184 --> 01:42:00.312
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

01:42:00.354 --> 01:42:02.980
or wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves.

01:42:04.190 --> 01:42:06.360
A short drop and a sudden stop.

01:42:10.405 --> 01:42:13.032
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervor,

01:42:13.075 --> 01:42:17.704
but I'm concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter.

01:42:17.788 --> 01:42:19.580
My apologies, Governor Swann.

01:42:19.665 --> 01:42:21.875
Actually, I find it all fascinating.

01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:23.708
Yes. That's what concerns me.

01:42:51.989 --> 01:42:54.407
Look! A boy!
There's a boy in the water!

01:42:56.868 --> 01:42:58.828
Man overboard!

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:01.789
Man the ropes!
Fetch a hook!

01:43:02.624 --> 01:43:03.958
Haul him aboard!

01:43:12.508 --> 01:43:14.427
He's still breathing.

01:43:14.510 --> 01:43:16.762
Mary, Mother of God!

01:43:23.228 --> 01:43:24.771
What happened here?

01:43:26.272 --> 01:43:29.983
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

01:43:32.029 --> 01:43:33.610
Lot of good it did them.

01:43:33.695 --> 01:43:36.282
Everyone's thinking it,
I'm just saying it.

01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:38.367
Pirates!

01:43:38.452 --> 01:43:41.287
There's no proof of that!

01:43:41.329 --> 01:43:42.870
It was probably an accident.

01:43:44.459 --> 01:43:46.249
Rouse the captain.

01:43:46.292 --> 01:43:48.209
- Aye, sir.
- Heave to and take in sail.

01:43:48.294 --> 01:43:49.961
- Launch the boats.
- Heave to!

01:43:52.132 --> 01:43:54.467
Elizabeth, I want you
to accompany the boy.

01:43:55.634 --> 01:43:56.969
He'll be in your charge.

01:43:57.012 --> 01:43:58.679
Take care of him.

01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:19.657
It's OK.

01:44:19.742 --> 01:44:22.494
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

01:44:23.829 --> 01:44:25.247
Will Turner.

01:44:26.249 --> 01:44:28.167
I'm watching over you, Will.

01:44:40.972 --> 01:44:42.931
You're a pirate!

01:44:43.015 --> 01:44:44.934
Has he said anything?

01:44:45.018 --> 01:44:46.602
His name's William Turner.

01:44:46.686 --> 01:44:48.186
That's all I found out.

01:44:49.188 --> 01:44:51.398
Take him below.

01:46:00.801 --> 01:46:02.594
Elizabeth!

01:46:04.429 --> 01:46:05.597
Are you all right?

01:46:07.017 --> 01:46:08.141
Are you decent?

01:46:08.768 --> 01:46:09.768
Yes.

01:46:09.811 --> 01:46:10.810
Yes?

01:46:12.313 --> 01:46:13.772
Still in bed at this hour?

01:46:15.816 --> 01:46:18.109
It's a beautiful day.

01:46:19.611 --> 01:46:21.197
I have a gift for you.

01:46:24.158 --> 01:46:27.117
- Oh, it's beautiful!
- Isn't it?

01:46:28.788 --> 01:46:31.207
May I inquire as to the occasion?

01:46:31.289 --> 01:46:34.708
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

01:46:34.792 --> 01:46:36.836
Go on.

01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:41.799
Actually, I...

01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:46.095
I had hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

01:46:46.138 --> 01:46:47.430
Ceremony?

01:46:47.473 --> 01:46:49.891
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.

01:46:49.975 --> 01:46:51.142
I knew it!

01:46:51.227 --> 01:46:54.520
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

01:46:54.605 --> 01:46:56.522
A fine gentleman, don't you think?

01:46:57.316 --> 01:46:58.816
He fancies you, you know.

01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:00.903
Elizabeth?

01:47:00.987 --> 01:47:02.654
How's it coming?

01:47:02.738 --> 01:47:05.323
It's difficult to say.

01:47:05.407 --> 01:47:07.659
I'm told it's
the latest fashion in London.

01:47:07.701 --> 01:47:09.076
Well, women in London

01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.828
must've learned not to breathe!

01:47:12.998 --> 01:47:14.667
My Lord, you have a visitor.

01:47:32.977 --> 01:47:34.185
Ah, Mr. Turner.

01:47:34.228 --> 01:47:35.687
Good to see you again.

01:47:35.771 --> 01:47:37.605
Good day, sir.

01:47:38.523 --> 01:47:39.690
I have your order.

01:47:45.197 --> 01:47:46.364
Well...

01:47:46.448 --> 01:47:48.199
The blade is folded steel.

01:47:48.284 --> 01:47:51.285
That's gold filigree
laid into the handle.

01:47:51.996 --> 01:47:53.246
If I may?

01:47:55.416 --> 01:47:56.873
Perfectly balanced.

01:47:57.667 --> 01:47:59.961
The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade.

01:48:02.881 --> 01:48:05.049
Impressive. Very impressive.

01:48:05.092 --> 01:48:06.426
Very nice.

01:48:07.094 --> 01:48:10.095
Commodore Norrington's going
to be very pleased with this.

01:48:11.222 --> 01:48:13.725
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

01:48:15.893 --> 01:48:16.893
I shall.

01:48:18.354 --> 01:48:21.691
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

01:48:23.192 --> 01:48:26.695
Elizabeth!
You look absolutely stunning.

01:48:26.738 --> 01:48:28.572
Will.

01:48:28.906 --> 01:48:31.742
It's so good to see you.

01:48:31.826 --> 01:48:33.493
I had a dream about you last night.

01:48:33.578 --> 01:48:34.578
About me?

01:48:34.662 --> 01:48:36.331
Is it entirely proper for you...?

01:48:36.415 --> 01:48:38.206
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

01:48:38.249 --> 01:48:41.084
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

01:48:41.127 --> 01:48:43.629
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

01:48:43.714 --> 01:48:46.007
At least once more, Miss Swann.

01:48:46.091 --> 01:48:47.924
As always.

01:48:47.966 --> 01:48:49.260
Now, you see?

01:48:49.303 --> 01:48:51.595
At least the boy
has a sense of propriety.

01:48:51.679 --> 01:48:52.930
We really must be going.

01:48:52.973 --> 01:48:53.973
Come on.

01:48:55.309 --> 01:48:56.600
Good day, Mr. Turner.

01:48:58.185 --> 01:48:59.187
Come along!

01:49:02.566 --> 01:49:03.773
Good day...

01:49:06.611 --> 01:49:08.112
...Elizabeth.

01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:40.495
Hold up there, you!

01:50:42.164 --> 01:50:45.499
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.

01:50:47.502 --> 01:50:49.211
And I shall need to know your name.

01:50:51.883 --> 01:50:54.176
What do you say to three shillings,

01:50:54.218 --> 01:50:55.469
and we forget the name?

01:50:58.931 --> 01:51:01.140
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

01:51:37.595 --> 01:51:39.428
Two paces... march!

01:51:41.973 --> 01:51:43.976
Right about... face!

01:51:46.521 --> 01:51:49.272
Present... arms!

01:52:13.547 --> 01:52:16.299
This dock is off-limits to civilians.

01:52:16.384 --> 01:52:18.133
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.

01:52:18.176 --> 01:52:20.887
If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

01:52:24.474 --> 01:52:28.101
Apparently, there's some high-toned
and fancy to-do up at the fort, eh?

01:52:28.143 --> 01:52:31.314
How could it be two upstanding
gentlemen, such as yourselves,

01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.358
did not merit an invitation?

01:52:33.442 --> 01:52:36.611
Someone has to make sure this dock
stays off-limits to civilians.

01:52:36.654 --> 01:52:39.031
It's a fine goal, to be sure.

01:52:39.114 --> 01:52:41.074
But it seems to me, a...

01:52:41.158 --> 01:52:42.908
A ship like that...

01:52:42.993 --> 01:52:45.996
...makes this one here
a bit superfluous, really.

01:52:46.038 --> 01:52:49.164
Oh, the Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true enough,

01:52:49.207 --> 01:52:53.168
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

01:52:53.211 --> 01:52:54.295
I've heard of one.

01:52:54.337 --> 01:52:57.006
It's supposed to be very fast,
nigh uncatchable.

01:52:57.090 --> 01:52:58.842
The Black Pearl.

01:53:01.387 --> 01:53:02.885
There's no real ship

01:53:02.970 --> 01:53:04.639
that can match the Interceptor.

01:53:06.309 --> 01:53:08.351
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

01:53:08.394 --> 01:53:10.019
No. No, it's not.

01:53:10.061 --> 01:53:11.395
Yes, it is. I've seen it!

01:53:12.146 --> 01:53:13.231
You've seen it?

01:53:13.316 --> 01:53:16.192
- Yes.
- You haven't seen it!

01:53:16.277 --> 01:53:18.984
- Yes, I have!
- You've seen a ship

01:53:19.027 --> 01:53:21.032
with black sails,

01:53:21.116 --> 01:53:22.782
that's crewed by the damned,

01:53:22.867 --> 01:53:25.367
and captained by a man so evil

01:53:25.410 --> 01:53:28.037
that hell itself spat him back out?

01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:31.081
No.

01:53:31.833 --> 01:53:34.250
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

01:53:34.335 --> 01:53:37.212
Oh... And no ship that's
not crewed by the damned,

01:53:37.297 --> 01:53:40.049
and captained by a man so evil
that hell spat him back out

01:53:40.091 --> 01:53:41.717
could possibly have black sails,

01:53:41.801 --> 01:53:44.053
therefore couldn't possibly
be any other ship

01:53:44.095 --> 01:53:47.555
than the Black Pearl,
is that what you're saying?

01:53:47.598 --> 01:53:48.724
No.

01:53:48.767 --> 01:53:50.058
Like I said,

01:53:50.142 --> 01:53:53.354
there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor...

01:53:55.816 --> 01:53:56.814
Hey!

01:53:58.278 --> 01:53:59.276
You!

01:53:59.778 --> 01:54:01.445
Get away from there!

01:54:01.529 --> 01:54:03.905
You don't have permission
to be aboard there!

01:54:03.947 --> 01:54:05.659
Sorry. It's such a pretty boat.

01:54:05.742 --> 01:54:06.741
Ship!

01:54:07.495 --> 01:54:08.494
What's your name?

01:54:08.577 --> 01:54:09.577
Smith!

01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:11.372
Or Smithy, if you like.

01:54:11.414 --> 01:54:14.709
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
Mr. Smith?

01:54:14.752 --> 01:54:15.751
Yeah, and no lies!

01:54:15.835 --> 01:54:17.295
All right then.

01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:18.379
I confess.

01:54:18.796 --> 01:54:22.091
It is my intention to commandeer
one of these ships, pick up a crew

01:54:22.174 --> 01:54:25.593
in Tortuga to rape, pillage, and pilfer
my weasely black guts out.

01:54:25.636 --> 01:54:27.553
I said, no lies!

01:54:27.596 --> 01:54:29.516
I think he's telling the truth.

01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:31.141
If he were telling the truth,

01:54:31.226 --> 01:54:32.477
he wouldn't have told us.

01:54:33.436 --> 01:54:36.980
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe
the truth, even if he told it to you.

01:54:47.701 --> 01:54:49.076
May I have a moment?

01:54:58.044 --> 01:54:59.794
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

01:54:59.837 --> 01:55:01.631
Yes.

01:55:02.716 --> 01:55:05.384
I apologize if I seem forward,

01:55:05.468 --> 01:55:07.554
but I must speak my mind.

01:55:10.433 --> 01:55:13.434
This promotion throws into sharp relief

01:55:13.476 --> 01:55:16.435
that which I have not yet achieved.

01:55:18.897 --> 01:55:20.650
A marriage to a fine woman.

01:55:22.193 --> 01:55:24.862
You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.

01:55:25.446 --> 01:55:26.822
I can't breathe.

01:55:26.906 --> 01:55:28.698
Yes, I...

01:55:28.782 --> 01:55:30.284
I'm a bit nervous myself.

01:55:33.162 --> 01:55:34.871
And then they made me their chief.

01:55:37.834 --> 01:55:38.876
Elizabeth?

01:55:41.587 --> 01:55:42.588
Elizabeth!

01:55:44.841 --> 01:55:47.550
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

01:55:50.053 --> 01:55:52.348
- Will you be saving her, then?
- I can't swim!

01:55:54.517 --> 01:55:56.517
Pearl of the King's Navy, you are!

01:55:56.560 --> 01:55:58.270
Do not lose these!

01:56:12.743 --> 01:56:13.952
What was that?

01:56:48.612 --> 01:56:50.237
Make way!

01:56:56.786 --> 01:56:57.786
I got her!

01:56:59.165 --> 01:57:00.331
She's not breathing!

01:57:00.416 --> 01:57:01.416
Move!

01:57:08.507 --> 01:57:10.258
I never would've thought of that.

01:57:10.342 --> 01:57:12.592
Clearly you've never been to Singapore.

01:57:18.183 --> 01:57:19.810
Where did you get that?

01:57:22.021 --> 01:57:24.231
On your feet.

01:57:25.607 --> 01:57:26.858
Elizabeth!

01:57:28.193 --> 01:57:30.193
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

01:57:35.158 --> 01:57:37.743
- Shoot him!
- Father! Commodore...

01:57:37.786 --> 01:57:39.828
...do you intend to kill my rescuer?

01:57:47.212 --> 01:57:49.005
I believe thanks are in order.

01:57:53.635 --> 01:57:56.470
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, did we?

01:57:56.513 --> 01:57:57.804
Pirate?

01:57:59.058 --> 01:58:00.349
Hang him.

01:58:00.434 --> 01:58:03.184
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

01:58:04.438 --> 01:58:05.772
Well, well.

01:58:05.815 --> 01:58:08.316
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:11.027
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

01:58:11.111 --> 01:58:12.988
Well, I don't see your ship...

01:58:13.031 --> 01:58:14.196
...captain.

01:58:14.281 --> 01:58:16.657
I'm in the market, as it were.

01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:18.701
He said he'd come to commandeer one.

01:58:18.784 --> 01:58:21.579
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his, sir.

01:58:25.042 --> 01:58:28.169
No additional shots nor powder.

01:58:30.005 --> 01:58:31.840
A compass that doesn't point north.

01:58:36.845 --> 01:58:39.513
And I half expected it
to be made of wood.

01:58:42.017 --> 01:58:44.936
You are, without doubt,
the worst pirate I've heard of.

01:58:45.938 --> 01:58:47.354
But you have heard of me.

01:58:50.316 --> 01:58:52.859
Commodore, I really must protest!

01:58:52.944 --> 01:58:54.527
Carefully, lieutenant.

01:58:54.570 --> 01:58:56.863
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!

01:58:56.907 --> 01:59:00.410
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness!

01:59:00.495 --> 01:59:02.202
But it seems enough to condemn him.

01:59:02.286 --> 01:59:03.746
Indeed.

01:59:05.289 --> 01:59:06.999
Finally.

01:59:07.042 --> 01:59:09.376
Wait, don't shoot!

01:59:09.418 --> 01:59:10.752
I knew you'd warm up to me.

01:59:10.836 --> 01:59:13.632
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please.

01:59:13.716 --> 01:59:15.383
And my hat.

01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:17.342
Commodore.

01:59:19.887 --> 01:59:23.224
- Elizabeth. It is Elizabeth, isn't it?
- It's Miss Swann.

01:59:23.266 --> 01:59:25.893
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.

01:59:25.936 --> 01:59:28.563
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

01:59:29.898 --> 01:59:31.316
Now, if you'll be very kind.

01:59:48.333 --> 01:59:49.749
Easy on the goods, darling.

01:59:51.170 --> 01:59:52.585
You're despicable.

01:59:52.670 --> 01:59:54.714
Sticks and stones, love.

01:59:54.756 --> 01:59:56.339
I saved your life, you save mine.

01:59:56.424 --> 01:59:57.424
We're square.

01:59:58.427 --> 01:59:59.633
Gentlemen...

01:59:59.718 --> 02:00:01.178
...my lady...

02:00:01.263 --> 02:00:04.597
...you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

02:00:04.682 --> 02:00:07.101
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:25.619
Whoa!

02:00:25.704 --> 02:00:27.162
Now, will you shoot him?

02:00:27.246 --> 02:00:28.914
Open fire!

02:00:30.666 --> 02:00:31.834
Ahh!

02:00:36.214 --> 02:00:37.630
Burn his heels!

02:00:46.556 --> 02:00:47.767
Take steady aim.

02:00:47.809 --> 02:00:49.141
Fire!

02:00:53.064 --> 02:00:55.066
Take cover, men!

02:00:55.150 --> 02:00:57.067
Gillette...

02:00:57.152 --> 02:00:59.987
...Mr. Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows.

02:01:00.364 --> 02:01:02.363
I would hate for him to miss it.

02:01:06.368 --> 02:01:07.786
Search upstairs!

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:10.331
Look lively, men!

02:01:52.456 --> 02:01:53.832
Whoa!

02:02:43.590 --> 02:02:45.717
Right where I left you.

02:02:52.267 --> 02:02:54.100
Not where I left you.

02:03:04.694 --> 02:03:06.529
You're the one they're hunting.

02:03:07.531 --> 02:03:08.698
The pirate!

02:03:09.450 --> 02:03:12.577
You seem somewhat familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:15.289
I make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

02:03:15.372 --> 02:03:16.413
Ah...

02:03:16.456 --> 02:03:19.124
It would be a shame to put
a black mark on your record.

02:03:19.209 --> 02:03:20.710
So if you'll excuse me...

02:03:24.215 --> 02:03:26.381
Do you think this wise, boy?

02:03:27.343 --> 02:03:30.510
Crossing blades with a pirate?

02:03:30.595 --> 02:03:31.971
You threatened Miss Swann.

02:03:35.016 --> 02:03:36.351
Only a little.

02:03:49.949 --> 02:03:53.117
You know what you're doing,
I'll give you that. Excellent form.

02:03:53.993 --> 02:03:55.702
But how's your footwork?

02:03:55.787 --> 02:03:57.872
If I step here...

02:03:59.251 --> 02:04:00.667
Very good.

02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:02.794
And now I step again.

02:04:07.507 --> 02:04:08.841
Ta.

02:04:28.737 --> 02:04:30.404
That is a wonderful trick.

02:04:31.699 --> 02:04:35.368
Except, once again,
you are between me and my way out.

02:04:35.452 --> 02:04:36.576
And now...

02:04:37.205 --> 02:04:38.620
...you have no weapon.

02:05:00.977 --> 02:05:02.602
Who makes all these?

02:05:04.062 --> 02:05:05.399
I do.

02:05:05.442 --> 02:05:07.733
And I practice with them...

02:05:08.276 --> 02:05:09.402
...three hours a day.

02:05:11.236 --> 02:05:13.405
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

02:05:20.078 --> 02:05:22.998
Or... perhaps the reason
you practice three hours a day

02:05:23.082 --> 02:05:24.917
is that you already found one,

02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:28.588
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

02:05:28.672 --> 02:05:31.090
You're not a eunuch, are you?

02:05:31.175 --> 02:05:34.135
I practice three hours a day
so that when I meet a pirate,

02:05:34.219 --> 02:05:35.594
I can kill him!

02:06:52.839 --> 02:06:53.881
You cheated.

02:06:53.966 --> 02:06:55.214
Pirate.

02:06:58.804 --> 02:07:00.846
- Move away!
- No.

02:07:00.888 --> 02:07:02.264
Please move?

02:07:02.348 --> 02:07:03.349
No!

02:07:03.392 --> 02:07:06.185
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

02:07:08.729 --> 02:07:10.729
This shot is not meant for you.

02:07:21.076 --> 02:07:23.076
There he is! Over here!

02:07:25.078 --> 02:07:27.036
Excellent work, Mr. Brown.

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:30.917
You've assisted in the capture
of a dangerous fugitive.

02:07:31.002 --> 02:07:33.294
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

02:07:34.295 --> 02:07:36.882
I trust you will always remember
that this is the day

02:07:36.924 --> 02:07:40.385
Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

02:07:40.428 --> 02:07:42.178
Take him away.

02:07:46.475 --> 02:07:49.393
- Come here, boy!
- Smell it?

02:07:49.436 --> 02:07:52.772
- Come here, boy!
- You want a nice, juicy bone?

02:07:52.857 --> 02:07:54.983
- Hey!
- Come here, boy!

02:07:55.066 --> 02:07:57.568
- Come here, boy!
- You can keep doing that forever.

02:07:57.653 --> 02:07:59.862
The dog is never going to move.

02:07:59.905 --> 02:08:04.200
Well, excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet!

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:06.661
Come on!

02:08:10.917 --> 02:08:12.208
There you go, miss.

02:08:12.250 --> 02:08:15.045
It was a difficult day for you,
I'm sure.

02:08:15.087 --> 02:08:17.756
I suspected Commodore Norrington
would propose,

02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:20.425
but I must admit,
I wasn't entirely prepared for it.

02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:22.761
I meant you being
threatened by that pirate!

02:08:22.803 --> 02:08:24.053
Sounds terrifying!

02:08:24.804 --> 02:08:27.557
Oh... Yes, it was terrifying.

02:08:27.601 --> 02:08:29.601
But... the Commodore proposed!

02:08:29.685 --> 02:08:31.268
Fancy that.

02:08:31.353 --> 02:08:32.937
Now that's a smart match, miss,

02:08:33.021 --> 02:08:35.147
if it's not too bold to say.

02:08:35.233 --> 02:08:36.608
It is a smart match.

02:08:37.776 --> 02:08:39.568
He's a fine man.

02:08:40.862 --> 02:08:43.366
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

02:08:44.449 --> 02:08:46.576
Well, that Will Turner,

02:08:46.618 --> 02:08:48.786
he's a fine man too.

02:08:48.828 --> 02:08:50.622
That is too bold.

02:08:50.706 --> 02:08:52.791
Well, beggin' your pardon, miss.

02:08:52.833 --> 02:08:54.500
It was not my place.

02:09:43.550 --> 02:09:46.552
Has my daughter given
you an answer yet?

02:09:46.636 --> 02:09:48.343
No, she hasn't.

02:09:48.386 --> 02:09:50.723
Well, she has had a very trying day.

02:09:52.393 --> 02:09:54.559
Ghastly weather, don't you think?

02:09:54.643 --> 02:09:56.520
Bleak. Really bleak.

02:09:58.316 --> 02:09:59.315
What's that?

02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:02.276
Cannon fire!

02:10:03.652 --> 02:10:05.529
Return fire!

02:10:05.572 --> 02:10:08.616
I know those guns!

02:10:13.579 --> 02:10:15.581
It's the Pearl!

02:10:15.664 --> 02:10:17.375
Black Pearl?

02:10:19.877 --> 02:10:21.503
I've heard stories.

02:10:21.546 --> 02:10:25.548
She's been preying on ships and
settlements for near ten years.

02:10:25.633 --> 02:10:27.218
Never leaves any survivors.

02:10:27.303 --> 02:10:28.719
No survivors.

02:10:28.762 --> 02:10:31.597
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

02:10:40.899 --> 02:10:42.652
Clear the dock!

02:10:56.205 --> 02:10:57.872
Mama!

02:11:04.464 --> 02:11:06.090
Hoist your oars!

02:11:11.053 --> 02:11:13.347
Come on, you!

02:12:04.106 --> 02:12:05.941
Sight the muzzle flash.

02:12:05.984 --> 02:12:06.984
Aim for the flashes.

02:12:07.068 --> 02:12:09.153
I need a full spread, fore and aft.

02:12:09.195 --> 02:12:10.862
Mr. Stevens, more cartridges!

02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:14.867
Governor!
Barricade yourself in my office.

02:12:15.826 --> 02:12:16.826
Good God!

02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:18.494
That's an order.

02:12:35.429 --> 02:12:37.723
Don't!

02:12:38.515 --> 02:12:39.682
Hello, chum.

02:12:43.938 --> 02:12:45.481
Up there! Go!

02:12:55.282 --> 02:12:57.910
Miss! They've come to kidnap you!

02:12:57.994 --> 02:13:00.536
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!

02:13:00.621 --> 02:13:01.789
In here!

02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:07.794
They haven't seen you. Hide, and the
first chance you get, run to the fort!

02:13:17.304 --> 02:13:18.930
Got ya! Haven't I?

02:13:22.434 --> 02:13:25.936
No! No! It's hot!

02:13:26.020 --> 02:13:27.898
- I'm burning!
- Come on!

02:13:32.361 --> 02:13:33.694
Come on, me lads!

02:14:00.931 --> 02:14:02.890
Come out.

02:14:11.858 --> 02:14:14.693
We know you're here, poppet.

02:14:15.779 --> 02:14:16.945
Poppet.

02:14:17.029 --> 02:14:18.072
Come out...

02:14:18.991 --> 02:14:21.201
...and we promise we won't hurt you.

02:14:21.286 --> 02:14:22.535
Eh?

02:14:24.287 --> 02:14:26.289
We will find you, poppet.

02:14:27.331 --> 02:14:29.750
You've got something of ours,

02:14:29.793 --> 02:14:31.585
and it calls to us.

02:14:37.301 --> 02:14:39.802
The gold calls to us.

02:14:40.845 --> 02:14:42.013
The gold.

02:14:48.145 --> 02:14:50.186
Hello, poppet.

02:14:50.731 --> 02:14:51.732
Parley!

02:14:52.441 --> 02:14:53.649
What?

02:14:53.691 --> 02:14:54.859
Parley.

02:14:54.943 --> 02:14:56.359
I invoke the right of parley.

02:14:56.444 --> 02:15:00.364
According to the code of Brethren, set
down by pirates Morgan and Bartholomew,

02:15:00.449 --> 02:15:03.534
- you have to take me to your captain.
- I know the code.

02:15:03.619 --> 02:15:06.327
If an adversary demands parley,
you can do them no harm

02:15:06.369 --> 02:15:09.164
- until the parley is complete.
- To blazes with the code!

02:15:09.248 --> 02:15:11.207
She wants to be taken to the captain.

02:15:12.711 --> 02:15:15.004
And she'll go, without a fuss.

02:15:16.047 --> 02:15:19.089
We must honor the code.

02:15:29.728 --> 02:15:31.102
Say goodbye!

02:15:35.818 --> 02:15:37.067
Goodbye.

02:15:41.196 --> 02:15:42.991
- Come on!
- Elizabeth!

02:15:44.492 --> 02:15:45.619
Well!

02:15:52.417 --> 02:15:53.999
Out of my way, scum!

02:16:06.639 --> 02:16:09.556
My sympathies, friend.
You've no manner of luck at all.

02:16:32.124 --> 02:16:35.334
Come on, doggy!
It's just you and me now.

02:16:35.419 --> 02:16:37.794
It's you and old Jack.
Come on.

02:16:37.878 --> 02:16:39.588
Come on. That's a boy!

02:16:39.631 --> 02:16:41.798
Good boy. Come get your bone!

02:16:41.882 --> 02:16:45.760
That's a good boy.
Come on, a bit closer, a bit closer.

02:16:45.845 --> 02:16:47.887
That's it! That's it, doggy!

02:16:47.930 --> 02:16:51.350
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy cur!

02:16:52.602 --> 02:16:54.269
Don't do that. No, no, no!

02:16:54.311 --> 02:16:55.979
I didn't mean it! I didn't...

02:17:02.862 --> 02:17:04.404
This ain't the armory!

02:17:06.115 --> 02:17:07.324
Well, well, well.

02:17:07.410 --> 02:17:10.285
Look what we have here, Twigg.

02:17:10.369 --> 02:17:12.455
Captain Jack Sparrow.

02:17:13.622 --> 02:17:15.789
Last time I saw you,

02:17:15.832 --> 02:17:17.625
you were all alone

02:17:17.710 --> 02:17:20.462
on a godforsaken island,

02:17:20.504 --> 02:17:22.715
shrinking into the distance.

02:17:22.799 --> 02:17:25.299
His fortunes aren't improved much.

02:17:25.383 --> 02:17:28.804
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

02:17:28.847 --> 02:17:31.890
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers

02:17:31.974 --> 02:17:33.516
and mutineers.

02:17:37.646 --> 02:17:39.147
So there is a curse.

02:17:40.857 --> 02:17:42.233
That's interesting.

02:17:42.319 --> 02:17:44.570
You know nothing of hell.

02:17:53.244 --> 02:17:55.245
That's very interesting.

02:18:30.699 --> 02:18:33.242
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.

02:18:33.327 --> 02:18:36.371
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

02:18:36.455 --> 02:18:40.290
- I am here to negotia...
- You will speak when spoken to!

02:18:41.293 --> 02:18:43.378
And ye will not lay a hand on those

02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:45.838
under the protection of parley.

02:18:46.465 --> 02:18:47.632
Aye, sir.

02:18:50.344 --> 02:18:52.262
My apologies, miss.

02:18:53.347 --> 02:18:54.681
Captain Barbossa,

02:18:54.723 --> 02:18:59.144
I am here to negotiate the cessation
of hostilities against Port Royal.

02:19:00.229 --> 02:19:04.274
A lot of long words in there, miss.
We are naught but humble pirates.

02:19:05.359 --> 02:19:06.944
What is it that you want?

02:19:07.028 --> 02:19:09.320
I want you to leave
and never come back.

02:19:11.782 --> 02:19:14.409
I'm disinclined
to acquiesce to your request.

02:19:15.995 --> 02:19:18.328
Means "no."

02:19:19.748 --> 02:19:20.748
Very well.

02:19:23.460 --> 02:19:25.336
I'll drop it.

02:19:29.383 --> 02:19:34.011
Me holds are burstin' with swag!
That bit of shine matters to us?

02:19:34.095 --> 02:19:35.138
Why?

02:19:36.265 --> 02:19:38.558
It's what you've been searching for.

02:19:38.601 --> 02:19:40.267
I recognize the ship.

02:19:40.351 --> 02:19:43.228
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!

02:19:43.271 --> 02:19:44.440
Did you now?

02:19:47.442 --> 02:19:48.442
Fine.

02:19:49.444 --> 02:19:51.029
I suppose if it is worthless,

02:19:51.113 --> 02:19:52.947
then there's no point in me keeping it.

02:19:52.990 --> 02:19:54.282
No!

02:20:05.210 --> 02:20:07.294
You have a name, missy?

02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:09.463
Elizabeth...

02:20:09.547 --> 02:20:10.881
...Turner.

02:20:12.008 --> 02:20:14.093
I'm a maid in the governor's household.

02:20:17.388 --> 02:20:18.806
Miss Turner!

02:20:20.017 --> 02:20:21.266
Turner!

02:20:21.309 --> 02:20:22.726
Bootstrap!

02:20:26.773 --> 02:20:29.441
And how does a maid come
to own a trinket such as that?

02:20:29.484 --> 02:20:32.069
Family heirloom, perhaps?

02:20:32.153 --> 02:20:34.656
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

02:20:36.242 --> 02:20:39.325
Very well. You hand it over,
we'll put your town to our rudder,

02:20:39.409 --> 02:20:40.619
and ne'er return.

02:20:54.342 --> 02:20:55.341
Our bargain?

02:20:58.346 --> 02:21:00.181
Still the guns and stow 'em.

02:21:00.224 --> 02:21:03.059
Signal the men, set the flags
and make good to clear port.

02:21:03.143 --> 02:21:04.851
Wait! You have to take me to shore.

02:21:04.894 --> 02:21:07.521
According to the code of
the order of the Brethren...

02:21:07.605 --> 02:21:11.275
Your return to shore was not part
of our negotiations nor our agreements,

02:21:11.359 --> 02:21:12.527
so I must do nothin'.

02:21:12.611 --> 02:21:15.697
Secondly, you must be a pirate
for the pirate's code to apply,

02:21:15.739 --> 02:21:17.364
and you're not, and thirdly...

02:21:17.407 --> 02:21:20.159
...the code is more of what
you'd call a guideline,

02:21:20.202 --> 02:21:21.702
instead of actual rules.

02:21:21.744 --> 02:21:24.161
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,

02:21:24.204 --> 02:21:25.706
Miss Turner.

02:21:46.393 --> 02:21:48.811
They've taken her!
They've taken Elizabeth!

02:21:48.895 --> 02:21:50.983
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

02:21:52.066 --> 02:21:54.151
We have to hunt them down!
We must save her!

02:21:54.235 --> 02:21:56.276
And where do you propose we start?

02:21:57.531 --> 02:22:01.198
If you have any information concerning
my daughter, please share it.

02:22:03.494 --> 02:22:05.245
That Jack Sparrow!

02:22:05.330 --> 02:22:07.582
He talked about the Black Pearl.

02:22:07.624 --> 02:22:09.541
Mentioned it is more what he did.

02:22:11.126 --> 02:22:14.254
Ask him where it is! Make a deal
with him, he could lead us to it.

02:22:14.297 --> 02:22:15.797
No.

02:22:15.882 --> 02:22:19.176
The pirates who invaded this fort
left Sparrow locked in his cell,

02:22:19.260 --> 02:22:22.261
ergo they are not his allies.

02:22:22.304 --> 02:22:25.307
Governor, we will establish
their most likely course...

02:22:25.391 --> 02:22:27.267
That's not good enough!

02:22:27.310 --> 02:22:29.269
Mr. Turner...

02:22:29.312 --> 02:22:32.856
...you are not a military man,
you are not a sailor.

02:22:33.898 --> 02:22:35.276
You are a blacksmith.

02:22:35.319 --> 02:22:38.153
And this is not the moment
for rash actions!

02:22:40.448 --> 02:22:43.449
Do not make the mistake of thinking
you are the only man here

02:22:43.533 --> 02:22:45.036
who cares for Elizabeth.

02:22:51.042 --> 02:22:52.792
Please...

02:22:57.172 --> 02:22:58.382
You! Sparrow!

02:22:58.466 --> 02:22:59.466
Aye?

02:22:59.509 --> 02:23:02.134
You are familiar with that ship,
the Black Pearl?

02:23:02.177 --> 02:23:03.552
I've heard of it.

02:23:03.637 --> 02:23:06.306
Where does it make berth?

02:23:07.308 --> 02:23:09.266
Have you not heard the stories?

02:23:10.977 --> 02:23:12.938
Captain Barbossa

02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:14.731
and his crew of miscreants

02:23:14.816 --> 02:23:17.401
sail from the dreaded Isla de Muerte.

02:23:17.485 --> 02:23:20.279
It's an island that
cannot be found, except

02:23:20.322 --> 02:23:23.406
by those who already know where it is.

02:23:23.490 --> 02:23:25.157
The ship's real enough,

02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:28.661
therefore its anchorage must be
a real place. Where is it?

02:23:29.664 --> 02:23:30.831
Why ask me?

02:23:31.499 --> 02:23:33.083
Because you're a pirate.

02:23:33.166 --> 02:23:35.836
And you want to turn
pirate yourself. ls that it?

02:23:37.087 --> 02:23:38.088
Never!

02:23:41.841 --> 02:23:43.510
They took Miss Swann.

02:23:43.553 --> 02:23:45.387
Oh. So it is that you found a girl!

02:23:45.471 --> 02:23:47.263
I see.

02:23:47.347 --> 02:23:50.101
If you're intending to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

02:23:50.185 --> 02:23:52.144
and so win fair lady's heart...

02:23:52.186 --> 02:23:54.813
...you'll have to do it alone, mate.

02:23:54.856 --> 02:23:56.939
I see no profit in it for me.

02:23:58.024 --> 02:23:59.276
I can get you out of here.

02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:01.026
How's that? The key's run off.

02:24:01.069 --> 02:24:02.695
I helped build these cells.

02:24:02.779 --> 02:24:05.532
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

02:24:06.826 --> 02:24:10.119
With the right leverage,
and the proper application of strength,

02:24:11.246 --> 02:24:12.664
the door will lift free.

02:24:15.042 --> 02:24:16.292
What's your name?

02:24:16.376 --> 02:24:18.294
Will Turner.

02:24:19.588 --> 02:24:21.923
That would be short for William,
I imagine.

02:24:22.008 --> 02:24:23.174
Good, strong name.

02:24:24.176 --> 02:24:26.092
No doubt named for your father?

02:24:27.723 --> 02:24:28.804
Yes.

02:24:28.889 --> 02:24:30.806
Uh-huh.

02:24:31.683 --> 02:24:33.017
Well, Mr. Turner,

02:24:33.058 --> 02:24:34.268
I've changed me mind.

02:24:34.937 --> 02:24:37.938
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear, on pain of death,

02:24:38.023 --> 02:24:40.232
I shall take you to the Black Pearl,

02:24:40.275 --> 02:24:41.942
and your bonny lass.

02:24:42.028 --> 02:24:44.029
Do we have an accord?

02:24:47.532 --> 02:24:49.366
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

02:24:49.409 --> 02:24:50.576
Get me out.

02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:57.875
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

02:25:04.466 --> 02:25:05.966
We're going to steal the ship?

02:25:07.761 --> 02:25:08.761
That ship?

02:25:08.845 --> 02:25:10.677
Commandeer.

02:25:10.762 --> 02:25:13.015
We're going to commandeer that ship.

02:25:13.099 --> 02:25:14.184
Nautical term.

02:25:14.853 --> 02:25:16.936
One question about your business, boy,

02:25:17.020 --> 02:25:18.437
or there's no use going.

02:25:18.522 --> 02:25:20.021
This girl...

02:25:20.105 --> 02:25:22.815
...how far are you willing to go
to save her?

02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:24.236
I'd die for her.

02:25:24.278 --> 02:25:25.485
Oh, good.

02:25:25.569 --> 02:25:27.571
No worries then.

02:25:46.592 --> 02:25:49.134
This is either madness or brilliance.

02:25:49.929 --> 02:25:53.556
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

02:26:23.210 --> 02:26:27.006
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.

02:26:27.090 --> 02:26:28.799
Aye! Avast!

02:26:32.012 --> 02:26:34.346
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.

02:26:35.223 --> 02:26:37.018
You'll never make it out of the bay.

02:26:37.059 --> 02:26:38.684
Son...

02:26:39.726 --> 02:26:42.562
...I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

02:26:42.646 --> 02:26:44.190
Savvy?

02:26:47.693 --> 02:26:48.693
Commodore!

02:26:48.736 --> 02:26:51.362
- Sir!
- They're taking the Dauntless!

02:26:53.034 --> 02:26:54.116
Commodore!

02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:56.535
They're taking the ship!

02:26:57.287 --> 02:26:59.872
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!

02:26:59.914 --> 02:27:01.372
Rash, Turner.

02:27:01.457 --> 02:27:03.041
Too rash.

02:27:04.585 --> 02:27:08.798
That is, without doubt,
the worst pirate I have ever seen.

02:27:12.094 --> 02:27:13.385
Here they come.

02:27:18.224 --> 02:27:20.475
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

02:27:27.024 --> 02:27:30.194
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

02:27:43.333 --> 02:27:46.126
Check the aft!

02:27:46.211 --> 02:27:48.586
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!
Now!

02:27:48.629 --> 02:27:50.005
Quickly, men

02:27:51.383 --> 02:27:52.674
Whoa!

02:27:55.093 --> 02:27:59.015
Thank you, commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

02:27:59.099 --> 02:28:01.683
We'd have had a hard time
of it by ourselves.

02:28:04.938 --> 02:28:06.979
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

02:28:07.064 --> 02:28:09.607
With the wind a quarter astern,
we won't catch them!

02:28:09.692 --> 02:28:12.611
I don't need to. Just get them
in range of the long nines.

02:28:12.696 --> 02:28:14.779
Hands, come about! Run out the guns!

02:28:14.822 --> 02:28:16.198
Bring out the guns!

02:28:16.282 --> 02:28:18.867
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

02:28:18.951 --> 02:28:22.787
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

02:28:24.081 --> 02:28:27.417
Commodore! He's disabled
the rudder chain, sir.

02:28:31.130 --> 02:28:33.131
Abandon ship!

02:28:36.969 --> 02:28:39.386
Let go the gear
and sheet home.

02:28:39.471 --> 02:28:41.931
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

02:28:43.143 --> 02:28:45.769
So it would seem.

02:28:54.236 --> 02:28:56.319
When I was a lad,
living in England,

02:28:56.404 --> 02:28:58.281
my mother raised me by herself.

02:28:58.366 --> 02:29:00.324
After she died, I came out here,

02:29:00.409 --> 02:29:02.243
looking for my father.

02:29:03.703 --> 02:29:04.829
Is that so?

02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:07.582
My father,

02:29:07.666 --> 02:29:09.041
Bill Turner?

02:29:09.126 --> 02:29:12.713
At the jail, it was only after you
learned my name that you agreed to help.

02:29:12.797 --> 02:29:15.506
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

02:29:15.549 --> 02:29:17.132
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

02:29:17.175 --> 02:29:19.176
You knew my father.

02:29:25.350 --> 02:29:26.391
I knew him.

02:29:26.476 --> 02:29:29.395
Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:32.899
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap," or "Bootstrap Bill."

02:29:32.982 --> 02:29:33.982
Bootstrap?

02:29:34.986 --> 02:29:37.403
Good man.
Good pirate.

02:29:37.488 --> 02:29:39.573
I swear, you look just like him.

02:29:39.657 --> 02:29:40.698
It's not true.

02:29:40.741 --> 02:29:42.534
He was a merchant sailor.

02:29:42.619 --> 02:29:44.869
A good, respectable man
who obeyed the law.

02:29:44.953 --> 02:29:47.120
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

02:29:48.498 --> 02:29:51.209
My father was not a pirate!

02:29:52.377 --> 02:29:54.377
Put it away, son.

02:29:54.462 --> 02:29:56.379
It's not worth you getting beat again.

02:29:56.464 --> 02:29:57.591
You didn't beat me.

02:29:57.675 --> 02:30:01.010
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

02:30:01.052 --> 02:30:03.887
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

02:30:11.229 --> 02:30:14.483
Now as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

02:30:14.567 --> 02:30:17.068
The only rules
that really matter are these:

02:30:17.153 --> 02:30:21.030
What a man can do,
and what a man can't do.

02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:22.907
For instance,

02:30:22.991 --> 02:30:26.117
you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man,

02:30:26.202 --> 02:30:27.245
or you can't.

02:30:27.287 --> 02:30:30.832
Pirate is in your blood, boy, so
you'll have to square with that someday.

02:30:31.707 --> 02:30:33.875
Now, me, for example.
I could let you drown,

02:30:33.918 --> 02:30:38.421
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies. Savvy?

02:30:38.756 --> 02:30:39.757
So...

02:30:44.804 --> 02:30:48.139
Can you sail under
the command of a pirate?

02:30:49.394 --> 02:30:50.725
Or can you not?

02:30:53.437 --> 02:30:54.479
Tortuga?

02:30:54.565 --> 02:30:56.314
Tortuga.

02:31:18.378 --> 02:31:20.798
More importantly, it is indeed

02:31:20.841 --> 02:31:22.717
a sad life that has never
breathed deep

02:31:22.801 --> 02:31:25.968
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

02:31:27.723 --> 02:31:28.847
What do you think?

02:31:33.144 --> 02:31:34.228
It'll linger.

02:31:34.313 --> 02:31:38.315
I'll tell you, mate, if every town
in the world were like this one,

02:31:38.399 --> 02:31:40.859
no man would ever feel unwanted.

02:31:42.821 --> 02:31:43.905
Scarlett!

02:31:45.824 --> 02:31:47.157
Not sure I deserved that.

02:31:48.951 --> 02:31:50.119
Giselle!

02:31:50.162 --> 02:31:51.160
Who was she?

02:31:51.244 --> 02:31:52.246
What?

02:31:54.540 --> 02:31:55.832
I may have deserved that.

02:31:58.086 --> 02:32:01.212
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

02:32:03.548 --> 02:32:05.675
Mother's love!

02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:06.760
Jack!

02:32:07.762 --> 02:32:10.890
You should know better than to
wake a man when he's sleepin'.

02:32:10.974 --> 02:32:14.852
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

02:32:14.937 --> 02:32:18.229
The man who did the waking buys
the man who was sleeping a drink,

02:32:18.314 --> 02:32:21.733
and the man who was sleeping drinks
it while listening to a proposition

02:32:21.817 --> 02:32:23.526
from the man who did the waking.

02:32:25.695 --> 02:32:27.531
Aye, that'll about do it.

02:32:32.370 --> 02:32:34.622
Blast! I'm already awake!

02:32:34.706 --> 02:32:36.081
That was for the smell.

02:32:39.377 --> 02:32:40.376
Eh...

02:32:46.551 --> 02:32:48.050
Keep a sharp eye.

02:32:55.183 --> 02:32:56.267
Now...

02:32:56.352 --> 02:32:58.813
...what's the nature
of this venture of your'n?

02:33:00.647 --> 02:33:05.069
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

02:33:06.570 --> 02:33:08.071
I know where it's going to be,

02:33:08.115 --> 02:33:09.905
and I'm gonna take it.

02:33:10.949 --> 02:33:11.951
Jack,

02:33:12.035 --> 02:33:14.327
it's a fool's errand!

02:33:14.412 --> 02:33:17.748
Well, you know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl!

02:33:17.791 --> 02:33:20.333
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

02:33:20.919 --> 02:33:22.252
All I need is a crew.

02:33:22.962 --> 02:33:24.962
What I hear tell of Captain Barbossa,

02:33:25.046 --> 02:33:28.049
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one!

02:33:28.092 --> 02:33:30.300
I'd say it's a good thing
I'm not a fool then.

02:33:30.386 --> 02:33:31.511
Prove me wrong!

02:33:32.177 --> 02:33:35.516
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:38.935
Let's just say
it's a matter of leverage, eh?

02:33:42.314 --> 02:33:43.606
Hm?

02:33:45.776 --> 02:33:46.818
Mm.

02:33:46.902 --> 02:33:48.277
Huh?

02:33:48.319 --> 02:33:49.446
Hm...

02:33:49.530 --> 02:33:50.530
Mm-hm-hm.

02:33:55.161 --> 02:33:56.161
The kid?

02:33:57.747 --> 02:34:00.749
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

02:34:01.834 --> 02:34:04.295
His only child. Savvy?

02:34:04.379 --> 02:34:06.296
Is he now?

02:34:09.259 --> 02:34:11.635
Leverage, says you.

02:34:11.719 --> 02:34:14.304
I think I feel
a change in the wind, says I.

02:34:14.387 --> 02:34:16.139
- Mm.
- I'll find us a crew.

02:34:16.182 --> 02:34:19.099
There's bound to be some sailors
on this rock, crazy as you.

02:34:19.143 --> 02:34:21.519
One can only hope.

02:34:21.604 --> 02:34:24.353
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

02:34:49.214 --> 02:34:51.007
You'll be dining with the captain,

02:34:51.050 --> 02:34:53.426
and he requests you wear this.

02:34:54.385 --> 02:34:57.972
Tell the captain I'm "disinclined
to acquiesce to his request."

02:34:59.140 --> 02:35:01.392
He said you'd say that.

02:35:01.477 --> 02:35:03.853
He also said, if that be the case...

02:35:03.938 --> 02:35:05.687
...you'll be dining with the crew,

02:35:05.730 --> 02:35:07.565
and you'll be naked.

02:35:13.989 --> 02:35:15.114
Fine.

02:35:31.756 --> 02:35:35.344
There's no need to stand on ceremony
no call to impress anyone.

02:35:35.387 --> 02:35:37.762
You must be hungry.

02:35:55.196 --> 02:35:56.404
Try the wine.

02:36:01.244 --> 02:36:04.246
And the apples. One of those next.

02:36:12.547 --> 02:36:14.214
It's poisoned.

02:36:15.758 --> 02:36:18.093
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

02:36:18.136 --> 02:36:21.596
Then release me. You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.

02:36:25.603 --> 02:36:27.644
You don't know what this is,

02:36:27.729 --> 02:36:29.105
do you?

02:36:29.190 --> 02:36:31.439
It's a pirate medallion.

02:36:31.481 --> 02:36:33.566
This is Aztec gold.

02:36:34.444 --> 02:36:37.236
One of 882 identical pieces

02:36:37.279 --> 02:36:40.866
they delivered in a stone chest
to Cortés himself.

02:36:41.952 --> 02:36:46.163
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

02:36:46.247 --> 02:36:50.083
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

02:36:50.126 --> 02:36:53.627
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

02:36:55.507 --> 02:36:57.133
...a terrible curse.

02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:03.012
Any mortal that removes but
a single piece from that stone chest...

02:37:04.015 --> 02:37:06.474
...shall be punished for eternity.

02:37:08.769 --> 02:37:12.147
I hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

02:37:12.232 --> 02:37:13.483
Aye.

02:37:14.276 --> 02:37:17.819
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

02:37:17.862 --> 02:37:20.781
Buried on an Isle of the Dead
what cannot be found,

02:37:20.823 --> 02:37:22.700
except for those who know where it is.

02:37:24.409 --> 02:37:25.743
Find it, we did.

02:37:27.413 --> 02:37:28.746
There be the chest.

02:37:28.830 --> 02:37:30.625
Inside be the gold.

02:37:31.583 --> 02:37:34.001
And we took 'em all!

02:37:34.045 --> 02:37:36.046
We spent 'em and traded 'em,

02:37:36.130 --> 02:37:37.798
and frittered 'em away

02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:40.591
on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

02:37:40.675 --> 02:37:42.678
The more we gave 'em away,

02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:45.389
the more we came to realize...

02:37:46.683 --> 02:37:48.850
...the drink would not satisfy.

02:37:50.103 --> 02:37:52.854
Food turned to ash in our mouths...

02:37:53.522 --> 02:37:56.107
...and all the pleasurable company
in the world

02:37:56.191 --> 02:37:58.193
could not slake our lust.

02:38:00.071 --> 02:38:02.864
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

02:38:04.618 --> 02:38:07.287
Compelled by greed we were, but now...

02:38:07.371 --> 02:38:10.705
...we are consumed by it.

02:38:21.884 --> 02:38:24.802
There is one way we can end our curse.

02:38:28.891 --> 02:38:31.851
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold

02:38:31.893 --> 02:38:33.311
must be restored,

02:38:33.395 --> 02:38:35.814
and the blood repaid.

02:38:38.568 --> 02:38:39.943
Thanks to ye,

02:38:40.028 --> 02:38:42.155
we have the final piece.

02:38:44.198 --> 02:38:46.490
And the... blood to be repaid?

02:38:46.575 --> 02:38:49.077
That's why there's no sense
to be killing ya.

02:38:49.871 --> 02:38:50.870
Yet.

02:38:52.914 --> 02:38:54.416
Apple?

02:38:56.962 --> 02:38:59.421
Ha-ha. Hah!

02:38:59.464 --> 02:39:02.381
Arrgh!

02:39:02.424 --> 02:39:03.967
No!

02:39:11.267 --> 02:39:12.267
I'm curious.

02:39:12.352 --> 02:39:15.269
After killing me, what is it
you're planning on doing next?

02:40:18.835 --> 02:40:21.044
Look!

02:40:21.129 --> 02:40:24.047
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

02:40:24.839 --> 02:40:28.093
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

02:40:28.177 --> 02:40:29.843
But neither are we dead.

02:40:31.096 --> 02:40:34.891
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

02:40:34.976 --> 02:40:37.351
Too long I've been starvin' to death,

02:40:37.436 --> 02:40:39.061
and haven't died!

02:40:39.687 --> 02:40:41.481
I feel nothing.

02:40:42.274 --> 02:40:45.192
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

02:40:46.611 --> 02:40:48.778
...nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

02:40:49.781 --> 02:40:54.286
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

02:40:54.370 --> 02:40:55.368
You're in one!

02:41:14.430 --> 02:41:16.390
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

02:41:25.609 --> 02:41:27.276
Feast your eyes, captain.

02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:30.278
All of them,
faithful hands before the mast.

02:41:30.362 --> 02:41:33.573
Every man worth his salt...

02:41:33.616 --> 02:41:35.659
...and crazy to boot.

02:41:35.744 --> 02:41:38.579
So this is your able-bodied crew?

02:41:44.419 --> 02:41:45.419
You, sailor!

02:41:45.504 --> 02:41:46.879
Cotton, sir.

02:41:46.922 --> 02:41:48.713
Mr. Cotton.

02:41:48.756 --> 02:41:52.091
Do you have the courage and fortitude
to follow orders and stay true

02:41:52.176 --> 02:41:53.761
in the face of danger and death?

02:41:53.803 --> 02:41:55.512
Mr. Cotton!

02:41:55.595 --> 02:41:56.722
Answer, man!

02:41:56.765 --> 02:41:58.182
He's a mute, sir.

02:41:58.266 --> 02:41:59.976
Poor devil had his tongue cut out.

02:42:00.061 --> 02:42:02.101
So he trained the parrot
to talk for him.

02:42:02.186 --> 02:42:04.064
No one's yet figured how.

02:42:07.274 --> 02:42:08.901
Mr. Cotton's parrot.

02:42:09.902 --> 02:42:11.403
Same question.

02:42:11.446 --> 02:42:14.198
- Wind in your sails.
- Wind in your sails.

02:42:15.326 --> 02:42:17.408
Mostly, we figure that means "yes."

02:42:17.451 --> 02:42:18.955
Of course it does.

02:42:19.037 --> 02:42:20.037
Satisfied?

02:42:20.997 --> 02:42:22.998
Well, you've proved they're mad!

02:42:23.083 --> 02:42:24.959
And what's the benefit for us?

02:42:35.470 --> 02:42:36.553
Anamaria!

02:42:38.473 --> 02:42:40.808
I suppose you didn't deserve
that one, either.

02:42:40.892 --> 02:42:42.809
No, that one I deserved.

02:42:42.851 --> 02:42:44.603
You stole my boat!

02:42:44.646 --> 02:42:45.728
Actually...

02:42:47.816 --> 02:42:50.192
Borrowed. Borrowed, without permission,

02:42:50.278 --> 02:42:52.860
but with every intention
of bringing it back to you.

02:42:52.945 --> 02:42:54.362
But you didn't!

02:42:54.446 --> 02:42:55.822
You'll get another one!

02:42:57.200 --> 02:42:58.200
I will!

02:42:58.285 --> 02:42:59.659
A better one.

02:42:59.743 --> 02:43:01.660
A better one!

02:43:01.744 --> 02:43:03.330
- That one!
- What one?

02:43:06.042 --> 02:43:07.209
That one?

02:43:10.671 --> 02:43:12.381
Aye. That one.

02:43:12.465 --> 02:43:14.048
- What say you?
- Aye!

02:43:14.133 --> 02:43:15.508
Aye!

02:43:15.593 --> 02:43:17.593
Anchors away!

02:43:17.677 --> 02:43:19.887
No, no, no, no, no!
It's frightful bad luck

02:43:19.972 --> 02:43:21.473
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

02:43:21.516 --> 02:43:24.183
It'll be far worse not to have her.

02:43:57.886 --> 02:44:00.928
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find,

02:44:01.013 --> 02:44:03.473
with a compass that doesn't work?

02:44:03.557 --> 02:44:05.517
Aye, the compass doesn't point north,

02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:08.393
but we're not trying
to find north, are we?

02:44:19.073 --> 02:44:21.449
We should drop canvas, sir.

02:44:21.533 --> 02:44:23.575
She can hold a bit longer.

02:44:25.787 --> 02:44:29.333
What's in your head that's put you
in such a fine mood, captain?

02:44:29.417 --> 02:44:31.417
We're catching up.

02:44:46.434 --> 02:44:48.434
Time to go, poppet.

02:45:43.991 --> 02:45:48.410
Dead men tell no tales...

02:45:50.955 --> 02:45:53.624
Puts a chill in the bones,
how many honest sailors

02:45:53.667 --> 02:45:55.500
have been claimed by this passage.

02:46:10.975 --> 02:46:13.351
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

02:46:13.394 --> 02:46:16.605
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
'fore he showed up in Tortuga

02:46:16.689 --> 02:46:19.358
with a mind to go after
the treasure of Isla de Muerte.

02:46:19.443 --> 02:46:20.692
That was before I met him,

02:46:20.777 --> 02:46:22.943
back when he was captain
of the Black Pearl.

02:46:23.821 --> 02:46:24.822
What?

02:46:28.494 --> 02:46:29.952
He failed to mention that.

02:46:30.036 --> 02:46:32.287
He plays things closer to the vest now.

02:46:32.371 --> 02:46:34.457
And a hard-learned lesson it was.

02:46:34.541 --> 02:46:37.418
Three days out on the venture,
the first mate says,

02:46:37.502 --> 02:46:40.587
"Everything's an equal share.
That should mean the location

02:46:40.671 --> 02:46:44.050
of the treasure too,"
so Jack gives up the bearings.

02:46:44.218 --> 02:46:46.385
That night, there was a mutiny.

02:46:47.428 --> 02:46:50.097
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

02:46:50.182 --> 02:46:52.850
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:56.229
Ah...

02:46:56.939 --> 02:46:59.358
So that's the reason for all the...

02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:03.109
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

02:47:04.071 --> 02:47:06.239
Now, Will, when a pirate's marooned,

02:47:06.323 --> 02:47:09.075
he's given a pistol with a single shot.
One shot...

02:47:09.117 --> 02:47:12.452
Well, that won't do much good hunting,
nor to be rescued.

02:47:12.537 --> 02:47:15.748
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

02:47:15.791 --> 02:47:19.168
that pistol starts to look
real friendly.

02:47:19.253 --> 02:47:21.254
But Jack, he escaped the island,

02:47:21.338 --> 02:47:22.921
and still has that single shot.

02:47:23.005 --> 02:47:25.590
Oh, he won't use it, though,
save on one man.

02:47:26.592 --> 02:47:28.635
His mutinous first mate.

02:47:28.719 --> 02:47:30.679
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

02:47:31.931 --> 02:47:34.892
- How did Jack get off the island?
- Well, I'll tell ye.

02:47:34.935 --> 02:47:37.062
He waded out into the shallows,

02:47:37.105 --> 02:47:39.688
and he waited there three days
and three nights,

02:47:39.773 --> 02:47:43.609
till all manner of sea creatures
came acclimated to his presence.

02:47:44.610 --> 02:47:46.153
And on the fourth morning,

02:47:46.238 --> 02:47:50.366
he roped a couple of sea turtles,
lashed them together and made a raft.

02:47:52.619 --> 02:47:55.035
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.

02:47:55.120 --> 02:47:56.414
Sea turtles!

02:47:58.667 --> 02:48:00.667
What did he use for rope?

02:48:05.632 --> 02:48:07.215
Human hair.

02:48:08.217 --> 02:48:09.634
From my back.

02:48:10.802 --> 02:48:12.179
Let go the anchor!

02:48:12.264 --> 02:48:14.639
Lower the anchor line!

02:48:14.724 --> 02:48:17.141
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.

02:48:17.767 --> 02:48:18.895
Captain.

02:48:18.979 --> 02:48:20.687
What if the worst should happen?

02:48:21.565 --> 02:48:24.066
- Keep to the code.
- Aye. The code.

02:48:49.885 --> 02:48:51.051
Move.

02:48:51.135 --> 02:48:53.136
Ten years of hoarding swag!

02:48:53.179 --> 02:48:55.679
And now we finally get to spend it!

02:48:58.518 --> 02:48:59.518
Oh.

02:49:03.022 --> 02:49:05.816
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men...

02:49:06.526 --> 02:49:10.235
...and you can buy an eye what
actually fits and is made of glass.

02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:13.240
This one does splinter
something terrible!

02:49:13.325 --> 02:49:15.534
Stop rubbing it!

02:49:16.660 --> 02:49:17.786
Oh!

02:49:35.179 --> 02:49:38.223
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

02:49:38.265 --> 02:49:40.557
The pirates' code.

02:49:40.643 --> 02:49:42.059
Any man who falls behind...

02:49:42.102 --> 02:49:44.436
...is left behind.

02:49:45.773 --> 02:49:48.066
No heroes amongst thieves, eh?

02:49:48.778 --> 02:49:51.861
You know, for having
such a bleak outlook on pirates,

02:49:51.904 --> 02:49:54.822
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

02:49:55.324 --> 02:49:56.908
Sprung a man from jail...

02:49:58.244 --> 02:50:00.744
...commandeered a ship of the fleet,

02:50:00.787 --> 02:50:03.331
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga...

02:50:05.501 --> 02:50:08.752
...and you're completely
obsessed with treasure!

02:50:11.507 --> 02:50:12.632
That's not true.

02:50:13.342 --> 02:50:15.092
I am not obsessed with treasure.

02:50:22.309 --> 02:50:25.060
Not all treasure
is silver and gold, mate.

02:50:25.103 --> 02:50:27.147
Gentlemen, the time has come!

02:50:27.231 --> 02:50:28.441
Hurrah!

02:50:28.525 --> 02:50:30.650
Salvation is nigh!

02:50:30.735 --> 02:50:32.151
Yeah!

02:50:32.235 --> 02:50:34.946
- Our torment is near an end!
- Elizabeth.

02:50:35.614 --> 02:50:38.491
For ten years,
we've been tested and tried,

02:50:38.575 --> 02:50:40.201
and each man-jack of you here

02:50:40.286 --> 02:50:43.288
has proved his mettle 100 times over.

02:50:43.330 --> 02:50:45.623
And 100 times again!

02:50:45.666 --> 02:50:47.750
Yeah!

02:50:47.792 --> 02:50:49.377
Suffered, I have!

02:50:50.128 --> 02:50:51.963
Punished, we were,

02:50:52.006 --> 02:50:53.547
the lot of us,

02:50:53.631 --> 02:50:56.967
disproportionate to our crime!

02:50:57.053 --> 02:50:58.845
Right!

02:50:58.929 --> 02:51:00.137
Here it is!

02:51:03.808 --> 02:51:07.437
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

02:51:09.438 --> 02:51:11.983
Every last piece that went astray,

02:51:12.026 --> 02:51:13.777
we have returned.

02:51:13.819 --> 02:51:15.527
Save for this!

02:51:15.612 --> 02:51:17.030
- Yeah!
- Jack!

02:51:17.114 --> 02:51:19.741
Not yet!

02:51:19.825 --> 02:51:22.326
We'll wait for the opportune moment.

02:51:22.410 --> 02:51:25.161
...Despairing
of ever finding the lass.

02:51:25.204 --> 02:51:27.041
When's that?

02:51:27.125 --> 02:51:29.834
When it's of greatest profit to you?

02:51:29.877 --> 02:51:31.210
May I ask you something?

02:51:32.587 --> 02:51:34.922
Have I ever given you
reason not to trust me?

02:51:36.300 --> 02:51:37.299
Do us a favor.

02:51:37.342 --> 02:51:39.468
I know it's difficult for you,

02:51:39.511 --> 02:51:41.553
but please, stay here,

02:51:41.638 --> 02:51:44.515
and try not to do anything stupid.

02:51:47.185 --> 02:51:49.687
And who among us
has paid the blood sacrifice

02:51:49.772 --> 02:51:52.023
- owed to the heathen gods?
- Aye!

02:51:52.108 --> 02:51:54.943
And whose blood must yet be paid?

02:51:55.027 --> 02:51:56.693
Hers!

02:51:58.863 --> 02:52:03.449
You know the first thing I'm going
to do after the curse is lifted?

02:52:05.787 --> 02:52:09.206
Eat a whole bushel of apples!

02:52:16.965 --> 02:52:18.966
Begun by blood,

02:52:19.050 --> 02:52:21.052
by blood undone.

02:52:25.514 --> 02:52:26.558
Sorry, Jack.

02:52:26.642 --> 02:52:29.183
I'm not going to be your leverage.

02:52:38.402 --> 02:52:40.570
That's it?

02:52:40.612 --> 02:52:42.282
Waste not.

02:53:20.278 --> 02:53:21.612
Did it work?

02:53:21.654 --> 02:53:24.531
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

02:53:31.622 --> 02:53:33.123
You're not dead!

02:53:34.167 --> 02:53:36.668
No.

02:53:36.753 --> 02:53:38.085
He shot me!

02:53:38.128 --> 02:53:41.673
It didn't work!
The curse is still upon us!

02:53:46.763 --> 02:53:49.224
You! Maid! Your father,
what was his name?

02:53:49.308 --> 02:53:51.558
Was your father William Turner?

02:53:51.893 --> 02:53:53.142
No.

02:53:53.185 --> 02:53:56.688
Where's his child? The child that sailed
from England eight years ago?

02:53:56.773 --> 02:53:59.816
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

02:53:59.900 --> 02:54:01.151
Where?

02:54:07.532 --> 02:54:08.700
You two!

02:54:09.825 --> 02:54:11.912
- You brought us the wrong person!
- Yeah!

02:54:12.871 --> 02:54:13.871
No!

02:54:14.625 --> 02:54:17.333
She had the medallion!
She's the proper age!

02:54:17.418 --> 02:54:20.045
She said her name
was Turner. You heard her!

02:54:21.923 --> 02:54:24.591
- I think she lied to us!
- Yeah!

02:54:25.842 --> 02:54:28.177
You brought us here for nothing!

02:54:28.220 --> 02:54:32.348
I won't take questionin' or second
guesses, not from you, Mr. Twigg!

02:54:32.391 --> 02:54:36.688
Who's to blame him? Every decision
you made has led us from bad to worse!

02:54:38.898 --> 02:54:41.483
It was you who sent
Bootstrap to the depths!

02:54:41.526 --> 02:54:42.525
Yeah!

02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:47.905
And it's you who brought us
here in the first place!

02:54:49.701 --> 02:54:52.368
If any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

02:54:54.663 --> 02:54:56.581
I say, we cut her throat,

02:54:56.666 --> 02:54:58.291
and spill all her blood!

02:54:58.375 --> 02:54:59.376
Just in case.

02:54:59.419 --> 02:55:00.876
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

02:55:00.961 --> 02:55:03.504
Yeah!

02:55:09.469 --> 02:55:10.720
The medallion!

02:55:10.762 --> 02:55:12.055
She's taken it!

02:55:12.097 --> 02:55:16.601
Get after her,
you feckless pack of ingrates!

02:55:22.190 --> 02:55:25.192
- Where's the oars?
- There's no oars!

02:55:25.235 --> 02:55:28.071
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!

02:55:37.164 --> 02:55:38.915
You!

02:55:40.250 --> 02:55:41.918
You're supposed to be dead!

02:55:41.961 --> 02:55:43.295
Am I not?

02:55:45.255 --> 02:55:46.255
Oh.

02:55:53.347 --> 02:55:54.804
Puh-la-lem.

02:55:56.185 --> 02:55:58.435
Puh-la-lie-lay-lool.

02:56:01.022 --> 02:56:02.646
Pah-lee-nee...

02:56:02.731 --> 02:56:05.483
...parsnip... par-sley...

02:56:05.568 --> 02:56:07.568
...par... partner, pardoner...

02:56:07.611 --> 02:56:08.610
Parley?

02:56:08.694 --> 02:56:10.529
That's the one! Parley!

02:56:11.281 --> 02:56:12.282
Parley!

02:56:12.325 --> 02:56:13.617
Parley?!

02:56:14.868 --> 02:56:18.663
Damn to the depths whatever
muttonhead thought up parley!

02:56:20.290 --> 02:56:22.583
That would be the French.

02:56:34.388 --> 02:56:35.597
Not more pirates!

02:56:35.640 --> 02:56:37.681
Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

02:56:38.643 --> 02:56:39.849
Mr. Gibbs?

02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:41.852
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

02:56:42.979 --> 02:56:45.482
Jack? Jack Sparrow?

02:56:46.732 --> 02:56:48.234
He fell behind.

02:56:55.783 --> 02:56:57.327
Keep to the code!

02:56:58.578 --> 02:57:01.371
- Weigh anchor!
- Hoist the sails!

02:57:01.455 --> 02:57:03.124
Split-quick, you dibbies!

02:57:09.338 --> 02:57:12.383
How the blazes
did you get off that island?

02:57:13.760 --> 02:57:17.220
When you marooned me on
that godforsaken spit of land,

02:57:17.304 --> 02:57:19.683
you forgot one
very important thing, mate.

02:57:21.267 --> 02:57:23.685
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

02:57:23.727 --> 02:57:27.356
Ah, well, I won't be
making that mistake...

02:57:27.399 --> 02:57:28.608
...again.

02:57:29.401 --> 02:57:32.861
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

02:57:32.945 --> 02:57:34.154
Aye.

02:57:34.907 --> 02:57:35.907
Kill him.

02:57:37.075 --> 02:57:39.742
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

02:57:42.414 --> 02:57:43.580
Hold your fire!

02:57:50.212 --> 02:57:52.756
You know whose blood we need?

02:57:54.468 --> 02:57:56.342
I know whose blood you need.

02:58:03.477 --> 02:58:06.059
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

02:58:06.144 --> 02:58:07.396
A pirate.

02:58:08.563 --> 02:58:09.900
Here.

02:58:09.984 --> 02:58:11.692
Let me.

02:58:11.735 --> 02:58:13.236
Thank you.

02:58:14.613 --> 02:58:17.197
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

02:58:19.075 --> 02:58:20.075
Why?

02:58:23.412 --> 02:58:24.703
I don't know.

02:58:26.666 --> 02:58:28.876
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

02:58:28.919 --> 02:58:33.506
- I know they're rough.
- No... I mean, yes, they are, but...

02:58:35.966 --> 02:58:37.759
But don't stop.

02:58:46.268 --> 02:58:47.685
Elizabeth!

02:59:03.620 --> 02:59:04.954
It's yours.

02:59:09.375 --> 02:59:12.795
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

02:59:12.837 --> 02:59:14.295
It was a gift from my father.

02:59:14.338 --> 02:59:16.465
He sent it to me.

02:59:22.138 --> 02:59:23.680
Why did you take it?

02:59:25.808 --> 02:59:28.560
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

02:59:30.145 --> 02:59:31.938
That would've been awful.

02:59:35.401 --> 02:59:37.193
It wasn't your blood they needed.

02:59:39.989 --> 02:59:42.241
It was my father's blood.

02:59:44.702 --> 02:59:47.287
My blood.

02:59:52.210 --> 02:59:53.585
The blood of a pirate.

02:59:53.669 --> 02:59:55.795
Will, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

03:00:09.144 --> 03:00:12.770
So you expect to leave me standin' on
some beach, with nothing but a name

03:00:12.855 --> 03:00:18.192
and your word it's the one I need,
and watch you sail away in my ship?

03:00:18.277 --> 03:00:19.444
No.

03:00:19.528 --> 03:00:23.656
I expect to leave you standing on some
beach with absolutely no name at all,

03:00:23.699 --> 03:00:25.784
watching me sail away on my ship,

03:00:25.869 --> 03:00:28.745
and then I'll shout
the name back to you.

03:00:28.829 --> 03:00:30.163
Savvy?

03:00:30.205 --> 03:00:33.249
That still leaves the problem
of me standing on some beach,

03:00:33.334 --> 03:00:37.170
with naught but a name and your word
it's the one I need.

03:00:38.212 --> 03:00:39.547
Of the two of us,

03:00:39.632 --> 03:00:43.426
I am the only one who
hasn't committed mutiny.

03:00:43.510 --> 03:00:47.512
Therefore, my word is
the one we'll be trusting.

03:00:47.555 --> 03:00:49.308
Although...

03:00:49.392 --> 03:00:52.018
I suppose I should be thanking you
because, in fact,

03:00:52.061 --> 03:00:54.353
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

03:00:55.396 --> 03:00:59.693
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

03:00:59.736 --> 03:01:01.110
Funny ol' world, isn't it?

03:01:01.194 --> 03:01:02.527
Hm.

03:01:05.115 --> 03:01:07.616
Captain! We're coming up
on the Interceptor.

03:01:20.756 --> 03:01:22.798
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

03:01:23.466 --> 03:01:25.258
What say we run up a flag of truce,

03:01:25.343 --> 03:01:27.136
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

03:01:27.220 --> 03:01:30.682
and I negotiate the return of your
medallion. What say you to that?

03:01:31.642 --> 03:01:35.144
You see, Jack, that's exactly
the attitude that lost you the Pearl.

03:01:35.229 --> 03:01:38.147
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

03:01:39.190 --> 03:01:40.525
Lock him in the brig.

03:01:52.787 --> 03:01:55.246
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!

03:01:55.288 --> 03:01:58.583
With this wind dead astern,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

03:01:58.626 --> 03:02:01.086
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl!

03:02:01.129 --> 03:02:02.336
She's gaining on us!

03:02:06.927 --> 03:02:09.303
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean!

03:02:09.388 --> 03:02:12.140
You can tell them that
after they've caught us!

03:02:12.182 --> 03:02:14.099
We're shallower on the draft, right?

03:02:14.142 --> 03:02:15.143
Aye.

03:02:15.227 --> 03:02:17.309
Can't we lose them amongst those shoals?

03:02:18.772 --> 03:02:20.480
We don't have to outrun 'em long.

03:02:20.523 --> 03:02:21.817
Just long enough.

03:02:21.860 --> 03:02:23.150
Lighten the ship!

03:02:23.234 --> 03:02:24.401
Stem to stern!

03:02:24.485 --> 03:02:27.572
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost!

03:02:36.998 --> 03:02:39.000
Apparently, there's a leak.

03:02:53.681 --> 03:02:56.851
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

03:02:56.894 --> 03:02:59.102
And run out the sweeps.

03:03:27.339 --> 03:03:29.007
We're gonna need that.

03:03:37.684 --> 03:03:40.477
It was a good plan, up till now.

03:03:40.562 --> 03:03:42.020
Gibbs!

03:03:42.063 --> 03:03:43.480
We have to make a stand.

03:03:43.564 --> 03:03:44.982
We must fight!

03:03:45.900 --> 03:03:48.026
- Load the guns!
- With what?

03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:49.820
Anything! Everything!

03:03:49.904 --> 03:03:51.613
Anything we have left!

03:03:53.659 --> 03:03:55.617
Load the guns!

03:03:55.701 --> 03:03:57.410
Case shot and langrage!

03:03:57.495 --> 03:03:59.079
Nails and crushed glass!

03:04:01.623 --> 03:04:02.792
With a will!

03:04:24.104 --> 03:04:26.940
The Pearl's gonna luff up
on our port quarter!

03:04:27.024 --> 03:04:29.609
She'll rake us without ever
presenting a target!

03:04:29.651 --> 03:04:31.736
Lower the anchor on the right side.

03:04:32.320 --> 03:04:33.738
On the starboard side!

03:04:34.783 --> 03:04:37.910
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady!

03:04:37.953 --> 03:04:38.952
You both are!

03:04:39.035 --> 03:04:40.453
Daft like Jack!

03:04:41.164 --> 03:04:42.664
Lower the starboard anchor!

03:04:43.292 --> 03:04:46.834
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

03:04:46.918 --> 03:04:48.461
Aye!

03:05:05.313 --> 03:05:06.563
Let go!

03:05:13.155 --> 03:05:14.821
They're club haulin'!

03:05:14.906 --> 03:05:17.656
Hard a port!
Rack the starboard oars!

03:05:17.741 --> 03:05:19.492
Hard a port!

03:05:30.879 --> 03:05:32.130
Keep her steady, man.

03:05:39.179 --> 03:05:40.179
Now!

03:05:40.263 --> 03:05:42.557
Fire!

03:05:52.317 --> 03:05:54.318
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

03:06:40.907 --> 03:06:43.076
We could use a few more ideas, lass!

03:06:43.160 --> 03:06:44.743
It's your turn!

03:06:44.786 --> 03:06:46.578
We need us a devil's dowry!

03:06:46.621 --> 03:06:47.954
We'll give them her!

03:06:48.958 --> 03:06:50.457
She's not what they're after.

03:06:53.044 --> 03:06:54.378
The medallion!

03:07:16.483 --> 03:07:19.069
Strike your colors,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

03:07:19.112 --> 03:07:21.864
Hands, grapnels, at the ready!

03:07:21.948 --> 03:07:23.783
Prepare to board!

03:07:31.416 --> 03:07:32.622
Ahh!

03:07:58.109 --> 03:08:00.943
Pistols and cutlasses, men!

03:08:00.986 --> 03:08:03.280
Koehler and Twigg
to the powder magazine!

03:08:03.323 --> 03:08:06.658
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

03:08:16.211 --> 03:08:18.630
Hey! Hey!

03:08:34.438 --> 03:08:37.065
Hey! Below!

03:08:56.876 --> 03:08:58.377
Thanks very much.

03:09:01.713 --> 03:09:03.299
Ha-haa!

03:09:07.679 --> 03:09:10.304
Whoa!

03:09:11.767 --> 03:09:12.766
Jack!

03:09:14.144 --> 03:09:15.935
Bloody empty!

03:09:31.868 --> 03:09:33.746
That's not very nice.

03:09:38.376 --> 03:09:39.584
Where is the medallion?

03:09:39.626 --> 03:09:40.712
Wretch!

03:09:42.463 --> 03:09:43.672
Ah...

03:09:43.756 --> 03:09:45.089
Where is dear William?

03:09:47.301 --> 03:09:48.551
Will!

03:09:50.762 --> 03:09:52.972
- Will!
- Elizabeth!

03:09:55.936 --> 03:09:57.060
Monkey!

03:10:03.735 --> 03:10:05.569
I can't move it!

03:10:06.945 --> 03:10:07.945
Will!

03:10:07.988 --> 03:10:09.114
Elizabeth!

03:10:09.156 --> 03:10:10.239
Will!

03:10:21.336 --> 03:10:23.461
Why, thank you, Jack.

03:10:23.545 --> 03:10:25.171
You're welcome.

03:10:25.255 --> 03:10:27.842
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

03:10:29.051 --> 03:10:31.969
Gents! Our hope is restored!

03:10:32.054 --> 03:10:33.472
Yeah!

03:11:08.006 --> 03:11:12.009
Any of you so much
as thinks the word parley,

03:11:12.094 --> 03:11:14.845
I'll have your guts for garters!

03:11:22.729 --> 03:11:24.146
Will!

03:11:24.189 --> 03:11:26.190
Stop it! Stop it!

03:11:27.067 --> 03:11:29.025
Welcome back, miss.

03:11:29.110 --> 03:11:31.861
You took advantage of
our hospitality last time.

03:11:31.904 --> 03:11:35.242
It holds fair now
that you return the favor!

03:11:35.660 --> 03:11:38.536
No! No!

03:11:41.206 --> 03:11:42.291
Barbossa!

03:11:44.251 --> 03:11:45.252
Will.

03:11:48.046 --> 03:11:49.046
She goes free!

03:11:50.172 --> 03:11:51.883
What's in your head, boy?

03:11:53.260 --> 03:11:54.552
She goes free.

03:11:55.220 --> 03:11:58.265
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

03:11:58.349 --> 03:12:00.349
Don't do anything stupid!

03:12:03.313 --> 03:12:04.562
You can't.

03:12:04.646 --> 03:12:06.062
I can.

03:12:07.775 --> 03:12:09.399
Like that.

03:12:10.446 --> 03:12:11.736
Who are you?

03:12:11.778 --> 03:12:13.280
No one! He's no one!

03:12:14.031 --> 03:12:17.033
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.

03:12:17.075 --> 03:12:19.577
- Lovely singing voice, though.
- Eunuch!

03:12:19.619 --> 03:12:21.286
My name is Will Turner!

03:12:21.370 --> 03:12:24.081
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

03:12:24.124 --> 03:12:26.084
His blood runs in my veins.

03:12:26.794 --> 03:12:29.086
It's the spitting image
of ol' Bootstrap Bill,

03:12:29.171 --> 03:12:30.962
come back to haunt us!

03:12:31.047 --> 03:12:33.050
On my word, do as I say,

03:12:33.092 --> 03:12:34.967
or I'll pull this trigger,

03:12:35.052 --> 03:12:37.260
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!

03:12:38.304 --> 03:12:40.598
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.

03:12:40.640 --> 03:12:41.807
Elizabeth goes free!

03:12:41.893 --> 03:12:43.517
Yes, we know that one.

03:12:43.602 --> 03:12:44.602
Anything else?

03:12:47.271 --> 03:12:48.565
And the crew!

03:12:48.608 --> 03:12:50.566
The crew are not to be harmed!

03:12:55.323 --> 03:12:57.113
Agreed.

03:13:03.329 --> 03:13:06.791
Go on, poppet. Walk the plank.

03:13:16.301 --> 03:13:17.969
Barbossa, you lying bastard!

03:13:18.053 --> 03:13:20.638
You swore she'd go free!

03:13:20.722 --> 03:13:22.974
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy!

03:13:23.058 --> 03:13:24.724
I agreed she'd go free.

03:13:24.809 --> 03:13:27.812
It was you who failed to specify
when or where.

03:13:33.527 --> 03:13:37.488
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it, lads?

03:13:37.531 --> 03:13:38.531
Aye.

03:13:39.533 --> 03:13:42.701
So I'll be havin' that dress
back before you go.

03:13:47.039 --> 03:13:49.167
I always liked you.

03:13:52.170 --> 03:13:54.505
Goes with your black heart!

03:13:55.090 --> 03:13:57.257
Mm. It's still warm.

03:14:00.636 --> 03:14:02.680
Off you go!

03:14:02.763 --> 03:14:04.098
Come on!

03:14:07.727 --> 03:14:08.893
Too long!

03:14:20.031 --> 03:14:22.532
I really rather hoped
we were past all this.

03:14:24.119 --> 03:14:25.535
Jack.

03:14:25.578 --> 03:14:26.663
Jack!

03:14:28.414 --> 03:14:29.874
Did ya not notice?

03:14:29.958 --> 03:14:34.210
That be the same island we made you
governor of on our last little trip.

03:14:35.504 --> 03:14:37.172
I did notice.

03:14:37.214 --> 03:14:41.384
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape,

03:14:41.427 --> 03:14:43.053
but I doubt it.

03:14:45.890 --> 03:14:47.432
Off you go.

03:14:48.434 --> 03:14:51.060
Last time you left me
a pistol with one shot.

03:14:51.145 --> 03:14:52.729
By the powers, you're right!

03:14:52.812 --> 03:14:54.941
Where be Jack's pistol?

03:14:55.025 --> 03:14:56.192
Bring it forward.

03:14:59.362 --> 03:15:02.156
Seeing as there's two of us,
a gentleman...

03:15:02.865 --> 03:15:04.658
...would give us a pair of pistols.

03:15:04.743 --> 03:15:06.451
It'll be one pistol, as before,

03:15:06.535 --> 03:15:09.328
and you can be the gentleman
and shoot the lady,

03:15:09.412 --> 03:15:11.248
and starve to death yourself!

03:15:35.606 --> 03:15:39.150
That's the second time I've had to watch
that man sail away with my ship.

03:15:41.613 --> 03:15:44.280
You were marooned on this island
before, weren't you?

03:15:44.364 --> 03:15:45.950
We can escape the same way!

03:15:45.992 --> 03:15:48.118
To what point and purpose, young missy?

03:15:48.870 --> 03:15:50.620
The Black Pearl is gone,

03:15:50.663 --> 03:15:54.123
and unless you have a rudder and
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

03:15:54.208 --> 03:15:56.626
Unlikely...

03:15:56.669 --> 03:15:59.628
Young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

03:16:02.299 --> 03:16:04.634
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow!

03:16:04.677 --> 03:16:09.097
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company!

03:16:09.139 --> 03:16:11.892
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot!

03:16:11.977 --> 03:16:14.227
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

03:16:16.772 --> 03:16:18.273
How did you escape last time?

03:16:25.114 --> 03:16:26.989
Last time...

03:16:27.031 --> 03:16:29.825
...I was here a grand total
of three days, all right?

03:16:30.828 --> 03:16:31.828
Last time...

03:16:33.872 --> 03:16:37.166
...the rum runners used this island
as a cache.

03:16:37.209 --> 03:16:39.668
They came by and I was able
to barter passage off.

03:16:39.752 --> 03:16:41.505
From the looks of things,

03:16:41.590 --> 03:16:43.798
they've long been out of business.

03:16:43.841 --> 03:16:48.970
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

03:16:49.013 --> 03:16:50.554
So that's it then?

03:16:51.848 --> 03:16:55.685
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow!

03:16:56.688 --> 03:16:58.479
You spent three days,

03:16:58.522 --> 03:17:00.857
lying on a beach, drinking rum.

03:17:03.236 --> 03:17:07.029
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

03:17:15.080 --> 03:17:17.247
♪ We're devils
We're black sheep

03:17:17.332 --> 03:17:18.499
♪ We're really bad eggs

03:17:18.542 --> 03:17:21.168
♪ Drink up, me hearties
Yo ho

03:17:21.211 --> 03:17:25.172
♪ Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me

03:17:25.214 --> 03:17:27.050
I love this song!

03:17:30.053 --> 03:17:32.220
Really bad eggs!

03:17:33.641 --> 03:17:35.642
Ooh...

03:17:37.100 --> 03:17:39.102
When I get the Pearl back,

03:17:39.186 --> 03:17:41.688
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,

03:17:41.731 --> 03:17:43.274
and we'll sing it all the time!

03:17:43.359 --> 03:17:47.152
And you will be positively the most
fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main!

03:17:47.236 --> 03:17:49.071
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

03:17:50.115 --> 03:17:51.823
The entire ocean!

03:17:51.908 --> 03:17:53.660
The entire world!

03:17:54.577 --> 03:17:56.578
Wherever we want to go, we go.

03:17:56.621 --> 03:17:58.205
That's what a ship is, you know.

03:17:58.247 --> 03:18:01.084
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

03:18:01.168 --> 03:18:02.669
That's what a ship needs.

03:18:02.753 --> 03:18:04.754
But what a ship is...

03:18:06.131 --> 03:18:09.091
What the Black Pearl really is...

03:18:10.552 --> 03:18:13.804
...is freedom.

03:18:14.805 --> 03:18:15.890
Jack...

03:18:15.933 --> 03:18:20.687
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

03:18:21.478 --> 03:18:22.689
Oh, yes.

03:18:22.773 --> 03:18:25.609
But the company is...

03:18:25.652 --> 03:18:28.444
...infinitely better than last time,
and the...

03:18:30.238 --> 03:18:33.949
...scenery has definitely improved.
- Mr. Sparrow!

03:18:33.991 --> 03:18:38.037
I'm not entirely sure I've had
enough rum to allow that kind of talk.

03:18:39.664 --> 03:18:41.457
I know exactly what you mean, love.

03:18:48.965 --> 03:18:50.509
To freedom!

03:18:53.261 --> 03:18:54.803
To the Black Pearl.

03:19:11.404 --> 03:19:14.448
Hm?

03:19:24.333 --> 03:19:25.419
No!

03:19:25.503 --> 03:19:28.296
Not good! Stop!

03:19:28.337 --> 03:19:29.546
Not good!

03:19:29.630 --> 03:19:30.630
What are you doing?

03:19:30.673 --> 03:19:32.759
You've burned all the food, the shade...

03:19:32.843 --> 03:19:35.094
...the rum!
- Yes, the rum is gone.

03:19:35.179 --> 03:19:36.427
Why is the rum gone?

03:19:36.887 --> 03:19:38.763
One, because it is a vile drink

03:19:38.847 --> 03:19:41.768
that turns even the most respectable
men into scoundrels.

03:19:41.852 --> 03:19:44.937
Two, that signal
is over 1,000 feet high.

03:19:45.022 --> 03:19:47.230
The entire Royal Navy
is out looking for me.

03:19:47.315 --> 03:19:49.691
Do you think there is even
the slightest chance

03:19:49.734 --> 03:19:50.901
they won't see it?

03:19:50.985 --> 03:19:52.818
But why is the rum gone?

03:19:53.905 --> 03:19:55.363
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

03:19:55.406 --> 03:19:57.201
You give it one hour, maybe two,

03:19:57.285 --> 03:20:02.203
keep a weather eye open, and you
will see white sails on that horizon.

03:20:07.710 --> 03:20:10.712
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

03:20:10.755 --> 03:20:13.840
"Must've been terrible for you..."
Well, it bloody is now!

03:20:21.223 --> 03:20:23.474
There'll be no
living with her after this.

03:20:24.476 --> 03:20:28.062
- We've got to save Will!
- No! You're safe now.

03:20:28.146 --> 03:20:30.232
We will return to
Port Royal immediately,

03:20:30.316 --> 03:20:32.276
not go gallivanting after pirates!

03:20:32.361 --> 03:20:34.278
Then we condemn him to death!

03:20:35.364 --> 03:20:38.072
The boy's fate is regrettable...

03:20:38.156 --> 03:20:40.742
...but then, so was his decision
to engage in piracy.

03:20:40.827 --> 03:20:44.079
To rescue me! To prevent anything
from happening to me!

03:20:44.163 --> 03:20:48.000
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion,

03:20:48.085 --> 03:20:51.253
the Pearl was listing
near to scuppers after the battle.

03:20:51.295 --> 03:20:54.213
It's very unlikely she'd be able
to make good time.

03:20:54.256 --> 03:20:55.590
Think about it.

03:20:55.675 --> 03:20:57.884
The Black Pearl.

03:20:57.927 --> 03:21:02.430
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

03:21:02.473 --> 03:21:04.433
How can you pass that up?

03:21:06.602 --> 03:21:09.437
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr. Sparrow,

03:21:09.480 --> 03:21:11.982
- not only myself.
- Commodore, I beg you!

03:21:12.067 --> 03:21:13.065
Please do this!

03:21:13.108 --> 03:21:14.733
For me!

03:21:14.776 --> 03:21:16.945
As a wedding gift.

03:21:17.028 --> 03:21:18.195
Elizabeth?

03:21:19.282 --> 03:21:21.825
Are you accepting
the commodore's proposal?

03:21:24.244 --> 03:21:25.287
I am.

03:21:26.122 --> 03:21:27.789
A wedding! I love weddings!

03:21:27.874 --> 03:21:29.624
Drinks all around!

03:21:31.918 --> 03:21:34.671
I know. "Clap him in irons," right?

03:21:37.217 --> 03:21:38.382
Mr. Sparrow...

03:21:39.719 --> 03:21:42.053
...you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

03:21:42.139 --> 03:21:44.639
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

03:21:44.682 --> 03:21:48.602
You'll then spend the rest of the voyage
contemplating all possible meanings

03:21:48.644 --> 03:21:51.145
of the phrase "silent as the grave."

03:21:51.187 --> 03:21:52.770
Do I make myself clear?

03:21:52.813 --> 03:21:54.901
Inescapably clear.

03:21:58.905 --> 03:22:01.156
Shiver me timbers!

03:22:01.948 --> 03:22:03.575
Cotton says you missed a bit.

03:22:08.579 --> 03:22:09.955
You knew William Turner?

03:22:11.834 --> 03:22:13.919
Old Bootstrap Bill.

03:22:14.003 --> 03:22:15.003
We knew him.

03:22:16.004 --> 03:22:20.007
Never sat well with Bootstrap,
what we did to Jack Sparrow,

03:22:20.050 --> 03:22:22.135
the mutiny and all.

03:22:22.718 --> 03:22:24.721
He said it wasn't right with the code.

03:22:25.805 --> 03:22:28.975
That's why he sent off a piece
of the treasure to you, as it were.

03:22:29.018 --> 03:22:32.645
He said we deserved to be cursed...

03:22:34.232 --> 03:22:36.316
...and remain cursed.

03:22:36.359 --> 03:22:37.399
Stupid blighter!

03:22:37.484 --> 03:22:39.317
Good man.

03:22:39.361 --> 03:22:44.616
But, as you can imagine, that
didn't sit too well with the captain.

03:22:44.699 --> 03:22:47.953
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all!

03:22:48.037 --> 03:22:51.664
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!

03:22:54.209 --> 03:22:58.294
So... what the captain did...

03:22:58.379 --> 03:23:00.965
...he strapped a cannon
to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

03:23:01.049 --> 03:23:02.550
Bootstrap's bootstraps.

03:23:02.593 --> 03:23:05.595
Last we saw of ol' Bill Turner...

03:23:05.680 --> 03:23:08.138
...he was sinking to
the crushin' black oblivion

03:23:08.223 --> 03:23:11.351
of Davy Jones' locker!

03:23:11.770 --> 03:23:14.853
'Course it was only after that
we learned we needed his blood

03:23:14.896 --> 03:23:16.105
to lift the curse.

03:23:16.189 --> 03:23:19.234
That's what you'd call ironic.

03:23:23.405 --> 03:23:25.031
Bring him!

03:23:32.246 --> 03:23:34.249
I don't care for the situation.

03:23:34.792 --> 03:23:37.876
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn into an ambush.

03:23:37.919 --> 03:23:41.256
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

03:23:41.340 --> 03:23:45.008
I go in and convince Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

03:23:45.092 --> 03:23:47.928
You and your men
return to the Dauntless

03:23:47.971 --> 03:23:51.224
and blast the bejesus out of them
with your little cannons.

03:23:51.267 --> 03:23:52.516
What do you have to lose?

03:23:53.602 --> 03:23:56.105
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

03:23:57.772 --> 03:23:59.648
Now, to be quite honest with you,

03:23:59.733 --> 03:24:02.694
there's still a slight risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

03:24:02.778 --> 03:24:06.572
which includes
the future Mrs. Commodore.

03:24:06.614 --> 03:24:09.700
- It's for your safety!
- Don't care what the Commodore ordered!

03:24:09.785 --> 03:24:10.784
I have to tell him!

03:24:10.827 --> 03:24:13.829
The pirates! They're cursed!
They can't be killed!

03:24:13.913 --> 03:24:16.457
Don't worry, miss.
He's already informed of that.

03:24:16.499 --> 03:24:20.209
A little mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story!

03:24:20.294 --> 03:24:22.378
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

03:24:33.851 --> 03:24:35.309
No reason to fret.

03:24:35.393 --> 03:24:37.978
Just a prick of the finger,
a few drops of blood...

03:24:38.021 --> 03:24:40.022
No mistakes this time.

03:24:40.106 --> 03:24:41.815
He's only half Turner.

03:24:41.900 --> 03:24:43.317
We spill it all!

03:24:45.736 --> 03:24:48.655
Guess there is reason to fret.

03:25:01.502 --> 03:25:03.379
Beg your pardon, mate.
Beg your pardon.

03:25:03.464 --> 03:25:05.506
- Begun by blood...
- Excuse me.

03:25:05.590 --> 03:25:08.300
By blood un...

03:25:10.678 --> 03:25:11.677
Jack!

03:25:12.722 --> 03:25:13.804
It's not possible!

03:25:13.846 --> 03:25:16.016
Not probable.

03:25:16.059 --> 03:25:17.852
Where's Elizabeth?

03:25:19.229 --> 03:25:21.479
She's safe, just like I promised.

03:25:21.522 --> 03:25:24.482
She's all set to marry Norrington,
just like she promised,

03:25:24.525 --> 03:25:26.901
and you get to die for her,
just like you promised.

03:25:26.985 --> 03:25:29.112
So we're all men of our word, really.

03:25:29.196 --> 03:25:32.491
Except for Elizabeth,
who is, in fact, a woman.

03:25:32.534 --> 03:25:33.951
Shut up! You're next!

03:25:37.497 --> 03:25:40.374
You don't want to be doing that, mate.

03:25:40.416 --> 03:25:42.375
No, I really think I do.

03:25:44.169 --> 03:25:46.046
Your funeral.

03:25:49.217 --> 03:25:51.217
And why don't I want to be doing it?

03:25:51.260 --> 03:25:52.928
Oh, because...

03:25:53.929 --> 03:25:56.264
Because the HMS Dauntless,

03:25:56.348 --> 03:25:58.766
the pride of the Royal Navy,

03:25:58.851 --> 03:26:02.103
is floating just off shore,

03:26:02.187 --> 03:26:04.021
waiting for you.

03:26:12.073 --> 03:26:13.240
What we doing here?

03:26:15.159 --> 03:26:18.578
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

03:26:18.620 --> 03:26:20.706
We catch 'em in a crossfire,

03:26:20.748 --> 03:26:23.583
and send 'em down to see Old Hob.

03:26:24.878 --> 03:26:27.254
I know why we're here. I meant...

03:26:27.338 --> 03:26:29.213
...why aren't we doing what it was...

03:26:29.256 --> 03:26:31.089
What Mr. Sparrow said we should do?

03:26:31.132 --> 03:26:32.634
With the cannons and all?

03:26:32.719 --> 03:26:35.761
Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.

03:26:38.389 --> 03:26:40.975
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

03:26:41.059 --> 03:26:42.936
Just hear me out, mate.

03:26:43.021 --> 03:26:46.772
You order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best...

03:26:47.859 --> 03:26:52.278
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt.
There you are with two ships.

03:26:52.362 --> 03:26:54.780
The makings of your very own fleet.

03:26:54.865 --> 03:26:58.452
'Course, you'll take the grandest
as your flagship, and who's to argue?

03:26:58.536 --> 03:26:59.952
But what of the Pearl?

03:27:01.579 --> 03:27:02.915
Name me captain.

03:27:02.957 --> 03:27:06.416
I'll sail under your colors,
I'll give you ten percent of me plunder,

03:27:06.459 --> 03:27:08.668
and you'll get to
introduce yourself as...

03:27:09.253 --> 03:27:12.131
...Commodore Barbossa.

03:27:12.174 --> 03:27:13.257
Savvy?

03:27:13.300 --> 03:27:15.509
I suppose, in exchange, you'll be

03:27:15.593 --> 03:27:18.429
- wanting me not to kill the whelp.
- No. Not at all!

03:27:18.472 --> 03:27:20.139
By all means, kill the whelp!

03:27:20.182 --> 03:27:22.600
Just not yet.

03:27:22.643 --> 03:27:24.811
Wait to lift the curse

03:27:24.853 --> 03:27:27.521
until the opportune moment.

03:27:30.984 --> 03:27:32.611
For instance...

03:27:34.488 --> 03:27:37.740
...after you've killed Norrington's men.

03:27:37.824 --> 03:27:39.408
Every...

03:27:39.493 --> 03:27:41.160
...last...

03:27:41.203 --> 03:27:42.663
...one.

03:27:52.298 --> 03:27:54.632
You've been planning this
from the beginning!

03:27:54.676 --> 03:27:56.259
Ever since you learned my name!

03:27:57.094 --> 03:27:58.093
Yeah.

03:28:00.428 --> 03:28:02.556
I want 50 percent of your plunder.

03:28:02.642 --> 03:28:03.641
- 15!
- 40!

03:28:03.684 --> 03:28:04.685
25!

03:28:05.852 --> 03:28:07.186
And I'll buy you the hat.

03:28:07.229 --> 03:28:09.230
A really big one.

03:28:10.023 --> 03:28:11.191
Commodore.

03:28:14.319 --> 03:28:15.527
We have an accord.

03:28:17.198 --> 03:28:19.490
All hands to the boats!

03:28:20.493 --> 03:28:21.617
Apologies.

03:28:21.702 --> 03:28:23.369
You give the orders.

03:28:24.706 --> 03:28:25.705
Gents...

03:28:26.708 --> 03:28:28.081
...take a walk!

03:28:32.920 --> 03:28:34.255
Not to the boats?

03:29:33.649 --> 03:29:36.567
Hold fire!

03:29:38.610 --> 03:29:41.404
This is just like what
the Greeks done at Troy!

03:29:42.783 --> 03:29:44.408
'Cept they was in a horse,

03:29:44.451 --> 03:29:45.910
instead of dresses.

03:29:46.620 --> 03:29:47.994
Wooden horse.

03:30:00.966 --> 03:30:01.967
A moment, please.

03:30:06.139 --> 03:30:07.137
Elizabeth?

03:30:10.393 --> 03:30:12.185
I just want you to know, I...

03:30:13.312 --> 03:30:15.772
I believe you made a very
good decision today.

03:30:16.606 --> 03:30:18.609
Couldn't be more proud of you!

03:30:19.111 --> 03:30:20.236
But, you know,

03:30:20.320 --> 03:30:23.238
even a good decision,
if made for the wrong reasons,

03:30:23.322 --> 03:30:24.824
can be a wrong decision.

03:30:33.835 --> 03:30:34.833
Lieutenant.

03:30:41.757 --> 03:30:44.175
Yoo-hoo.

03:30:54.019 --> 03:30:55.187
Elizabeth?

03:30:57.356 --> 03:30:58.606
Are you there?

03:31:00.859 --> 03:31:03.486
Elizabeth, are you even listening to me?

03:31:29.930 --> 03:31:32.683
Oh, what have you done?

03:31:32.726 --> 03:31:36.311
- Yoo-hoo.
- Stop that! I already feel like a fool!

03:31:37.354 --> 03:31:39.856
Look nice, though.

03:31:43.235 --> 03:31:45.653
Do I look nice now?!

03:32:21.607 --> 03:32:22.857
I must admit, Jack.

03:32:22.942 --> 03:32:24.859
I thought I had you figured.

03:32:24.944 --> 03:32:28.112
But it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

03:32:28.197 --> 03:32:30.155
Me, I'm dishonest.

03:32:30.240 --> 03:32:33.077
And a dishonest man you can
always trust to be dishonest.

03:32:33.119 --> 03:32:34.369
Honestly...

03:32:34.453 --> 03:32:37.079
...it's the honest ones
you want to watch out for.

03:32:37.121 --> 03:32:39.414
'Cause you can never predict

03:32:39.457 --> 03:32:42.752
when they're going to do
something incredibly...

03:32:42.795 --> 03:32:43.794
...stupid.

03:33:01.437 --> 03:33:02.604
Ha-ha!

03:33:02.647 --> 03:33:03.689
Ha-ha!

03:33:03.773 --> 03:33:05.108
Ha!

03:33:16.954 --> 03:33:19.162
You're off the edge of the map, mate.

03:33:19.247 --> 03:33:21.290
Here, there be monsters!

03:33:29.174 --> 03:33:31.257
What would you pick to eat first?

03:33:31.341 --> 03:33:33.261
I think we should decide now,

03:33:33.345 --> 03:33:35.513
just so we're ready when the time comes!

03:34:00.582 --> 03:34:01.705
What was that?

03:34:06.209 --> 03:34:07.253
Oh.

03:34:19.933 --> 03:34:22.183
Shh!

03:34:24.646 --> 03:34:25.646
It's Elizabeth!

03:34:46.250 --> 03:34:47.919
Make for the ship! Move!

03:34:52.091 --> 03:34:53.506
Ahh!

03:34:57.345 --> 03:34:59.137
To the ship!

03:35:01.934 --> 03:35:05.061
Marines, arms!

03:35:41.514 --> 03:35:43.265
You can't beat me, Jack.

03:36:07.539 --> 03:36:09.082
That's interesting!

03:36:19.968 --> 03:36:21.844
I couldn't resist, mate.

03:36:43.910 --> 03:36:46.161
Oh, no.

03:37:28.245 --> 03:37:29.453
Sorry!

03:37:38.548 --> 03:37:40.215
So, what now, Jack Sparrow?

03:37:40.258 --> 03:37:42.926
Are we to be two immortals,
locked in an epic battle

03:37:43.010 --> 03:37:45.344
until Judgment Day,
when the trumpets sound?

03:37:45.428 --> 03:37:46.428
Hm?

03:37:46.471 --> 03:37:47.889
Or you could surrender.

03:37:56.649 --> 03:37:59.984
Ahh!

03:38:00.068 --> 03:38:01.903
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha.

03:38:15.208 --> 03:38:16.417
All of you with me!

03:38:16.459 --> 03:38:18.544
Will is in that cave,
and we must save him!

03:38:18.628 --> 03:38:21.213
Ready, and... heave!

03:38:27.804 --> 03:38:29.805
Please, I need your help! Come on!

03:38:29.890 --> 03:38:32.641
Any port in a storm.

03:38:32.726 --> 03:38:34.811
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl!

03:38:34.895 --> 03:38:37.146
What about Jack?
Are you just gonna leave him?

03:38:37.229 --> 03:38:39.023
Jack owes us a ship!

03:38:39.106 --> 03:38:40.650
There's the code to consider.

03:38:41.236 --> 03:38:42.359
The code?

03:38:44.113 --> 03:38:46.571
You're pirates!
Hang the code

03:38:46.655 --> 03:38:48.325
and hang the rules!

03:38:48.367 --> 03:38:50.785
They're more like guidelines, anyway.

03:38:54.581 --> 03:38:56.750
Bloody pirates!

03:39:06.344 --> 03:39:08.092
- Oi!
- What?

03:39:08.177 --> 03:39:10.346
Is it supposed to be doing that?

03:39:10.430 --> 03:39:12.640
They're stealing our ship!

03:39:13.100 --> 03:39:14.766
Bloody pirates!

03:39:16.854 --> 03:39:18.689
Boarders away!

03:39:26.904 --> 03:39:28.905
Come on!

03:39:54.099 --> 03:39:56.140
No! Me eye!

03:39:57.227 --> 03:39:58.935
No!

03:40:13.243 --> 03:40:14.784
Ha!

03:40:16.078 --> 03:40:18.162
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain!

03:40:18.247 --> 03:40:19.790
You like pain?

03:40:21.626 --> 03:40:23.002
Try wearing a corset.

03:40:33.387 --> 03:40:35.014
Whose side is Jack on?

03:40:35.098 --> 03:40:38.143
At the moment?

03:41:12.343 --> 03:41:14.218
No fair!

03:41:38.243 --> 03:41:40.078
Ten years you carry that pistol,

03:41:40.162 --> 03:41:42.497
and now you waste your shot!

03:41:43.499 --> 03:41:46.459
He didn't waste it.

03:42:11.110 --> 03:42:12.611
I feel...

03:42:17.200 --> 03:42:18.492
...cold.

03:42:48.605 --> 03:42:51.608
Oh... Ugh! Oh!

03:43:20.761 --> 03:43:23.221
Parley?

03:43:23.264 --> 03:43:25.142
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

03:43:25.226 --> 03:43:27.603
Huzzah! Huzzah!

03:43:36.403 --> 03:43:39.281
Huzzah!

03:44:13.481 --> 03:44:15.816
We should return to the Dauntless.

03:44:18.363 --> 03:44:21.989
Your fiancé will be wanting
to know you're safe.

03:44:31.668 --> 03:44:34.961
If you were waiting for
the opportune moment...

03:44:35.962 --> 03:44:37.296
...that was it.

03:44:38.756 --> 03:44:40.925
Now if you'd be so kind,
I'd be much obliged

03:44:41.009 --> 03:44:43.844
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

03:44:48.433 --> 03:44:50.601
I'm sorry, Jack.

03:44:52.521 --> 03:44:54.729
They done what's right by them.

03:44:54.814 --> 03:44:56.566
Can't expect more than that.

03:45:12.165 --> 03:45:13.498
Jack Sparrow!

03:45:13.541 --> 03:45:17.628
- We have learned that you...
- Captain! Captain Jack Sparrow.

03:45:18.338 --> 03:45:21.590
...For your willful commission
of crimes against the crown.

03:45:21.674 --> 03:45:25.386
Said crimes being numerous in quantity,

03:45:25.470 --> 03:45:27.012
and sinister in nature.

03:45:27.681 --> 03:45:29.180
The most egregious of these

03:45:29.223 --> 03:45:31.434
to be cited herewith:

03:45:31.519 --> 03:45:35.270
- Piracy, smuggling...
- This is wrong.

03:45:36.272 --> 03:45:39.274
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law,

03:45:39.358 --> 03:45:41.901
as are we all.

03:45:41.944 --> 03:45:44.654
...Impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

03:45:44.739 --> 03:45:47.825
impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England...

03:45:47.909 --> 03:45:49.033
Oh, yes!

03:45:49.075 --> 03:45:51.077
Sailing under false colors,

03:45:51.162 --> 03:45:55.373
arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching,

03:45:55.417 --> 03:46:01.379
brigandage, pilfering,
depravity, depredation,

03:46:01.422 --> 03:46:03.215
and general lawlessness.

03:46:04.632 --> 03:46:06.302
And for these crimes,

03:46:06.386 --> 03:46:08.928
you have been sentenced to be,
on this day,

03:46:08.972 --> 03:46:12.725
hung by the neck, until dead.

03:46:12.768 --> 03:46:15.061
May God have mercy on your soul.

03:46:15.103 --> 03:46:16.644
Governor Swann.

03:46:16.729 --> 03:46:18.648
Commodore.

03:46:20.149 --> 03:46:21.149
Elizabeth.

03:46:22.610 --> 03:46:25.446
I should've told you every day,
from the moment I met you.

03:46:28.240 --> 03:46:29.783
I love you.

03:46:44.340 --> 03:46:46.092
Oi, watch yourself!

03:46:46.134 --> 03:46:47.259
Marines!

03:46:47.302 --> 03:46:48.843
I can't breathe!

03:46:50.639 --> 03:46:51.678
Elizabeth!

03:46:54.767 --> 03:46:55.810
Move!

03:46:56.685 --> 03:46:58.977
Goodness sake!

03:47:06.695 --> 03:47:08.904
You men! With me!

03:47:20.167 --> 03:47:21.334
Move!

03:47:31.094 --> 03:47:32.679
Come on!

03:47:42.774 --> 03:47:43.897
Come on, men!

03:48:09.509 --> 03:48:13.510
I thought we might have to endure some
manner of ill-conceived escape attempt.

03:48:14.346 --> 03:48:15.929
But not from you.

03:48:16.014 --> 03:48:19.851
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

03:48:19.894 --> 03:48:21.560
And this is how you thank me?

03:48:21.603 --> 03:48:23.687
By throwing in your lot with him?

03:48:23.730 --> 03:48:25.314
He's a pirate!

03:48:25.399 --> 03:48:27.359
And a good man.

03:48:28.151 --> 03:48:30.403
If all I've achieved here
is that the hangman

03:48:30.446 --> 03:48:32.572
will own two pairs
of boots instead of one,

03:48:32.656 --> 03:48:34.282
so be it.

03:48:34.366 --> 03:48:36.242
At least my conscience will be clear.

03:48:36.285 --> 03:48:39.246
You forget your place, Turner.

03:48:40.788 --> 03:48:42.415
It's right here,

03:48:42.458 --> 03:48:43.917
between you and Jack.

03:48:47.923 --> 03:48:49.589
As is mine.

03:48:49.673 --> 03:48:51.048
Elizabeth!

03:48:52.510 --> 03:48:53.674
Lower your weapons.

03:48:54.470 --> 03:48:56.470
For goodness sake, put them down!

03:49:01.561 --> 03:49:04.480
So this is where
your heart truly lies, then.

03:49:06.105 --> 03:49:07.607
It is.

03:49:16.114 --> 03:49:19.744
Well! I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

03:49:19.787 --> 03:49:22.329
I think we've all arrived
at a very special place, eh?

03:49:22.413 --> 03:49:23.706
- Oh.
- Spiritually.

03:49:23.790 --> 03:49:25.791
Ecumenically.

03:49:25.876 --> 03:49:27.960
Grammatically.

03:49:28.544 --> 03:49:31.128
I want you to know that
I was rooting for you, mate.

03:49:32.424 --> 03:49:33.424
Know that.

03:49:37.429 --> 03:49:38.930
Elizabeth.

03:49:40.890 --> 03:49:43.475
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

03:49:44.936 --> 03:49:46.813
I'm sorry.

03:49:48.941 --> 03:49:49.941
Will!

03:49:52.236 --> 03:49:53.903
Nice hat.

03:49:55.864 --> 03:49:57.447
Friends!

03:49:59.367 --> 03:50:02.161
This the day that you will always

03:50:02.204 --> 03:50:04.831
remember as the day that...

03:50:09.795 --> 03:50:12.462
Idiot! He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose!

03:50:14.883 --> 03:50:16.718
Sail ho!

03:50:24.269 --> 03:50:26.895
What's your plan of action?

03:50:27.645 --> 03:50:28.645
Sir?

03:50:33.027 --> 03:50:35.484
Perhaps on the rare occasion

03:50:35.527 --> 03:50:39.407
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

03:50:39.491 --> 03:50:43.286
piracy itself can be the right course?

03:50:47.540 --> 03:50:48.833
Mr. Turner!

03:50:54.923 --> 03:50:57.758
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

03:51:03.723 --> 03:51:05.349
This is a beautiful sword.

03:51:07.810 --> 03:51:09.561
I would expect the man who made it

03:51:09.604 --> 03:51:14.400
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

03:51:16.444 --> 03:51:18.196
Thank you.

03:51:21.074 --> 03:51:22.114
Commodore!

03:51:22.199 --> 03:51:23.910
What about Sparrow?

03:51:25.827 --> 03:51:28.746
Oh, I think we can afford
to give him one day's head start.

03:51:35.253 --> 03:51:36.923
So...

03:51:38.006 --> 03:51:41.093
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

03:51:42.469 --> 03:51:44.761
After all...

03:51:44.804 --> 03:51:46.349
...he is a blacksmith.

03:51:47.350 --> 03:51:48.601
No.

03:51:53.314 --> 03:51:55.608
He's a pirate.

03:52:20.632 --> 03:52:22.299
Heave!

03:52:31.852 --> 03:52:34.437
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the code, eh?

03:52:34.479 --> 03:52:37.148
We figured they were more actual...

03:52:37.232 --> 03:52:39.192
...guidelines.

03:52:43.322 --> 03:52:45.031
Thank you.

03:52:46.158 --> 03:52:47.534
Captain Sparrow.

03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:53.414
The Black Pearl is yours!

03:53:09.222 --> 03:53:10.849
On deck, you scabrous dogs!

03:53:10.933 --> 03:53:12.601
Hands to braces!

03:53:12.685 --> 03:53:14.769
Let go and haul to run free.

03:53:16.439 --> 03:53:18.231
Now...

03:53:18.316 --> 03:53:20.150
Bring me that horizon.

03:53:27.448 --> 03:53:29.534
♪ ...And really bad eggs

03:53:32.872 --> 03:53:35.373
♪ Drink up, me hearties
Yo ho ♪
