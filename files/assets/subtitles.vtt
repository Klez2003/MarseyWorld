00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:02.664
- It's already recording...
- Okay.

00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:04.749
This is my home...

00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:07.836
- You look blurry. I'll zoom out.
- Okay.

00:01:08.587 --> 00:01:09.588
Good morning.

00:01:09.838 --> 00:01:11.423
- Got it?
- Okay, I got it.

00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:13.008
This is my home, ...

00:01:14.926 --> 00:01:16.595
...which I am leaving for the weekend...

00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:19.514
...to investigate the Blair Witch.

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:22.767
Essential reading: "How to Stay
Alive in the Woods", ...

00:01:22.976 --> 00:01:24.603
...'cause you never know what's
gonna happen.

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:26.438
And this is an important book...

00:01:26.688 --> 00:01:29.941
...because it has the article about what
happened at Coffin Rock.

00:01:30.192 --> 00:01:30.859
It looks pretty old...

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:33.278
It's totally old.
And this is my field notebook.

00:01:33.445 --> 00:01:36.114
It's Mr. Punctuality.

00:01:37.282 --> 00:01:39.326
How are you this morning?

00:01:39.784 --> 00:01:40.452
Tired.

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.120
So I got the CP up.

00:01:42.287 --> 00:01:42.954
Good.

00:01:44.206 --> 00:01:46.791
That's what we're shooting on.

00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.294
No one knows I took it,
but I got it.

00:01:49.544 --> 00:01:51.963
Come into the house. Come on.

00:01:53.548 --> 00:01:54.966
I can see you.

00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:58.887
We're not gonna bump into shit,
I'm going backwards now.

00:01:59.137 --> 00:02:00.972
We mustn't fuck up the cameras.

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:02.974
So where's Mikey?

00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:04.893
- We have to go get him.
- Okay.

00:02:05.143 --> 00:02:06.061
At 8:30.

00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:07.062
Okay.

00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:10.065
We're already behind schedule, but
it's important to have juice.

00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:11.066
That's cool.

00:02:11.232 --> 00:02:12.817
I guess you're Mike!

00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:16.488
Wait. Stop.

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:22.577
Don't we get to meet your Mama?

00:02:26.831 --> 00:02:28.583
See you later, Mom!

00:02:29.584 --> 00:02:31.252
How are you, Mike?

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:32.587
I'm tired but I'm fine.

00:02:32.837 --> 00:02:35.256
I'm real excited about this.
Thank you for the opportunity.

00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:38.176
I'm very glad. Thanks for
getting the equipment together.

00:02:38.426 --> 00:02:40.512
We've got enough
battery power to...

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.139
...fuel a small country for a month.

00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:46.768
We've got rice, fruit punch...

00:02:47.602 --> 00:02:49.104
Oatmeal Raisin, baby.

00:02:49.437 --> 00:02:51.356
The ultimate campfood.

00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:55.110
Feel how soft.

00:02:58.405 --> 00:03:01.533
- Marshmallows...
- Hey, you weasel. Out of my cart!

00:03:06.955 --> 00:03:08.456
Do you believe in ghosts?

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.875
Ever heard of the Blair Witch?

00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:17.549
Sounds familiar.
My sister went to Blair High School.

00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:22.053
The woods around Halloween
are creepy.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.724
- Can you tell me a little more?
- I don't wanna go cheesy.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.893
I want to present
this straightforward.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.229
The legend is unsettling.

00:03:31.563 --> 00:03:33.064
Wanna get the...

00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:36.317
...ceremonial first slate?

00:03:37.318 --> 00:03:38.820
Absolutely.

00:03:40.822 --> 00:03:44.159
The first slate for our
first shot.

00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:48.496
Should we get our fingers open
and bleed on it?

00:03:48.913 --> 00:03:50.331
A little blood-letting?

00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:51.916
No, we'll save that for later.

00:03:52.083 --> 00:03:53.918
Kiss the slate.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.754
It's the first slate.

00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:58.756
Marked by my lipstick.

00:03:58.923 --> 00:04:01.593
Mikey, kiss it, good luck.

00:04:01.843 --> 00:04:03.761
- There we go.
- Oh, he licked it. Bless him.

00:04:04.012 --> 00:04:05.847
Don't eat it. We're gonna need it.

00:04:06.514 --> 00:04:09.684
This is Burkittsville,
formerly Blair.

00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:13.188
A small quiet Maryland town.

00:04:13.688 --> 00:04:16.274
Like a small, quiet town anywhere.

00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:21.029
Some 20 families laid roots here
over 200 years ago.

00:04:21.696 --> 00:04:24.699
Many remain, either on this hill...

00:04:25.116 --> 00:04:27.035
...or in the town below.

00:04:28.286 --> 00:04:31.789
An unusually high number of
children are buried here...

00:04:32.207 --> 00:04:34.542
...most of whom passed
in the 1940's.

00:04:35.293 --> 00:04:39.464
Yet no one here recalls anything
unusual about this time, ...

00:04:39.797 --> 00:04:41.633
...not to us, anyway.

00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:43.927
Yet legend tells
A different story, ...

00:04:44.135 --> 00:04:46.471
...whose evidence is all around us.

00:04:47.138 --> 00:04:48.806
Etched in stone.

00:04:55.563 --> 00:04:59.150
We have shot the first scene,
the cemetery scene.

00:04:59.317 --> 00:05:01.194
The opening is shot.

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.156
We're doing a documentary
about the Blair Witch.

00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:10.119
- Have you heard of the Witch?
- That's an old, old story.

00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:11.496
As I remember, ...

00:05:11.746 --> 00:05:14.832
...Mr. Parr was an old hermit, ...

00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:19.003
...and he lived up on a mountain.
He'd been there, ...

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.546
...for a long, long, time.

00:05:20.713 --> 00:05:22.966
- You heard of the Blair Witch?
- Several times.

00:05:23.174 --> 00:05:25.426
What was the first incident?

00:05:25.593 --> 00:05:29.263
I've heard stories about it
from people and neighbors,

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.642
I also saw a documentary on the
television...

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.104
...about her and legends
of Maryland, ...

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.941
...my grandmother told us the story
to make us go to bed early.

00:05:40.108 --> 00:05:43.528
They say if you stay up after dark
or walk around the house...

00:05:43.695 --> 00:05:45.279
...the Blair witch will get you.

00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:49.742
In the fall or winter of 1940, ...

00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:53.037
...some young kids
started disappearing.

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:54.956
Nobody knew...

00:05:55.707 --> 00:05:57.875
...why they were disappearing.

00:06:00.211 --> 00:06:03.297
- A kind of an omen, isn't it?
- The creepiest story about her...

00:06:03.965 --> 00:06:06.300
...was that two men out hunting...

00:06:06.384 --> 00:06:10.054
...camped near the cabin
she's supposed to haunt...

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:10.972
No. No.

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.391
...and they just disappeared
forever.

00:06:14.142 --> 00:06:17.145
I'm just telling a scary story,
but it's not true.

00:06:17.395 --> 00:06:18.229
It's not true.

00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:21.733
One day, old Mr. Parr
came into the market...

00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:24.152
...and said "I'm finally finished".

00:06:24.318 --> 00:06:25.319
And what did he mean by that?

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.155
Nobody knew at first...

00:06:27.405 --> 00:06:29.323
But the police finally...

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.075
went up the mountain...

00:06:31.826 --> 00:06:36.080
...and found the bodies of seven
kids in his house.

00:06:36.497 --> 00:06:39.834
He would take the kids down
to the basement in twos...

00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:42.336
...and he'd make one
face the corner...

00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:45.089
...and he'd kill the other one...

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.676
...then he'd kill the one in
the corner too.

00:06:49.177 --> 00:06:50.678
Those were the seven kids
that were missing

00:06:50.845 --> 00:06:53.848
They brought the kids out of
the woods one at a time...

00:06:54.015 --> 00:06:57.268
...it was terrible, it upset
the whole community.

00:06:57.435 --> 00:06:59.353
He said he couldn't take
the eyes watching him...

00:06:59.604 --> 00:07:03.441
...that's why he made them
face the corner like that.

00:07:03.608 --> 00:07:05.443
All my life I've believed...

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.362
...in witches and ghosts and
that kind of stuff

00:07:08.446 --> 00:07:10.364
Do you believe there are some
in this area?

00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:11.199
Oh, definitely.

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:13.367
- Do you believe in witchcraft?
- No.

00:07:14.368 --> 00:07:16.537
- Are you religious?
- Yep.

00:07:16.787 --> 00:07:17.705
Alrighty.

00:07:17.872 --> 00:07:22.043
Creepy stuff, but I think
something's happening with her.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.545
And do you think she could
still be up there now?

00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:26.547
- I don't go up there.
- You don't?

00:07:26.714 --> 00:07:28.049
I believe enough not to go.

00:07:28.216 --> 00:07:31.636
They say the woods are haunted
and stuff like that.

00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:33.554
What? How are they haunted?

00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:37.892
Well there's not many people
who say that it's haunted...

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:40.394
...but there was this old woman,
Mary Brown, who...

00:07:40.645 --> 00:07:41.646
Mary Brown?

00:07:41.812 --> 00:07:43.898
Yeah, and she was kind of crazy.

00:07:44.148 --> 00:07:45.983
How was she seen by the community?

00:07:46.234 --> 00:07:46.817
Crazy.

00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:51.072
There's the American flag,
it's Mary's house.

00:07:51.822 --> 00:07:52.907
I'm gonna bring her out.

00:07:53.157 --> 00:07:55.243
You look for the best light, okay?

00:07:55.493 --> 00:07:56.077
Okay.

00:07:58.913 --> 00:08:01.415
This is Mary's gate.

00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:05.169
I'm not even sure how to open it.

00:08:06.337 --> 00:08:09.257
And something interesting
happened to you once...

00:08:09.423 --> 00:08:11.592
You met the Blair witch?

00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:13.177
Yes.

00:08:13.344 --> 00:08:14.595
That is really...

00:08:14.929 --> 00:08:17.348
...kind of a scary story.

00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:19.684
To make ends meet...

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.435
...my Dad and I

00:08:21.686 --> 00:08:23.938
...used to fish at Tappy's Creek.

00:08:24.272 --> 00:08:27.108
In Burkittsville.

00:08:27.775 --> 00:08:30.528
I was laying on the leaves...

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:34.282
...watching my pole, and
looking at the sky...

00:08:34.699 --> 00:08:38.703
...and suddenly I felt
something near me...

00:08:39.203 --> 00:08:41.038
...an eerie feeling...

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:43.708
...It was a woman...

00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:46.627
...only on her
arms and hands...

00:08:46.794 --> 00:08:48.629
...and everything...

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:50.381
...she had hair...

00:08:51.132 --> 00:08:53.467
...dark, almost black hair...

00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:55.636
...like a horse...

00:08:55.886 --> 00:08:58.305
...like a fur, horse fur.

00:08:58.556 --> 00:08:59.807
Then on her arm...

00:09:00.224 --> 00:09:01.976
...she had a shawl...

00:09:02.727 --> 00:09:04.812
And she scared you,
or threatened you?

00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:09.066
She didn't say anything,
she just stared...

00:09:09.233 --> 00:09:11.152
...and then she opened her shawl...

00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:12.903
What was under there?

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.073
She had hair on her
body like a horse.

00:09:16.323 --> 00:09:17.575
Hairy from head to toe?

00:09:17.783 --> 00:09:20.161
Yeah. And her legs...

00:09:20.494 --> 00:09:23.497
- How about her face?
- You could see she was a female.

00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:26.584
She was just strange looking.

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:29.754
Thank God she's
not in the film business.

00:09:30.004 --> 00:09:33.132
She thinks she is.
She also says she's a ballerina.

00:09:33.424 --> 00:09:34.467
Get out.

00:09:34.633 --> 00:09:36.427
And she says she's a historian...

00:09:36.594 --> 00:09:37.428
I heard that.

00:09:37.595 --> 00:09:39.930
...and that she's a scientist
at the Department of Energy.

00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:43.267
I fucked up on Mary
with the depth of field.

00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:46.228
You measured it in meters?
We're not in Europe.

00:09:46.812 --> 00:09:48.856
The fucking lens
has meters on it.

00:09:49.106 --> 00:09:51.525
It also has our system.

00:09:52.443 --> 00:09:55.029
Nah, it has meters. Look.

00:09:57.114 --> 00:09:58.949
But it's an American camera.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.534
All those are meters.

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:02.536
What about the brown ones?

00:10:02.703 --> 00:10:03.788
They're feet.

00:10:03.954 --> 00:10:05.748
The brown ones are on there, right?

00:10:05.915 --> 00:10:08.542
Yeah, but the white
ones are obvious.

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:12.546
- Didn't you use this camera before?
- Yeah. Once before.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.715
How was today, guys?

00:10:15.966 --> 00:10:17.635
I learned a lot, man.

00:10:17.802 --> 00:10:19.553
About Mary Brown?

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.431
No, I learned a lot about...

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.225
16 mill?

00:10:24.642 --> 00:10:27.228
...about shooting, just
shooting documentaries.

00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:30.314
- We kicked some ass today.
- Cheers.

00:10:30.648 --> 00:10:31.815
Very good day.

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:32.691
Excellent day.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.151
Very good first day.

00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:37.905
Let's do an equipment check,
after I call my mom.

00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:41.200
- I got a bag of Utz and a beer.
- We don't need that on film.

00:10:41.492 --> 00:10:43.327
So I guess you're covered then.

00:10:43.494 --> 00:10:47.081
Could you run it a little
to check it's okay?

00:10:47.623 --> 00:10:48.499
Sure.

00:10:48.832 --> 00:10:52.503
I just want to check it's loaded
properly so we can shoot...

00:10:53.837 --> 00:10:56.549
Okay, that's good, that's good.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.926
That's good, thank you.

00:10:59.677 --> 00:11:02.179
Let's relax, because we've got
a long day tomorrow.

00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:04.598
Today's been easy.

00:11:04.848 --> 00:11:07.434
We're gonna have to do a lot
of hiking, carry a lot of weight.

00:11:07.685 --> 00:11:09.061
We're preparing.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.523
Shut up, smart-ass.
Pour me a shot, please.

00:11:12.773 --> 00:11:16.360
- I'm freaking out.
- You can't, you're the director.

00:11:16.527 --> 00:11:20.364
I fucking have to do this now,
okay? Do we have any weed?

00:11:21.699 --> 00:11:22.866
Here I go.

00:11:23.617 --> 00:11:25.369
Drink! Drink!

00:11:28.205 --> 00:11:30.124
I hate fucking scotch.

00:11:37.047 --> 00:11:38.132
There's my friend Josh.

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:39.800
How are you?

00:11:39.967 --> 00:11:40.884
I'm hurtin'.

00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:42.970
I'm not ready for that thing yet.

00:11:43.304 --> 00:11:44.888
I know you don't like it.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.310
Hello. Welcome to day two.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.812
The trail is along here.

00:11:52.062 --> 00:11:54.481
It should be pretty obvious.

00:11:55.983 --> 00:11:57.901
You guys heard of
the Blair witch?

00:11:58.152 --> 00:12:00.904
I heard the myth. I don't
really believe much in it.

00:12:01.238 --> 00:12:02.072
The myth?

00:12:02.156 --> 00:12:03.907
That's all I think it is.

00:12:04.074 --> 00:12:05.159
What'd you say, sir?

00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:07.745
- I said damn fool kids never learn.
- Shut up.

00:12:07.995 --> 00:12:09.496
Damn fool kids never learn?

00:12:09.663 --> 00:12:10.414
That's what I said.

00:12:10.581 --> 00:12:11.915
Why do you say that?

00:12:12.082 --> 00:12:14.418
First of all, can I
have your permission...

00:12:14.585 --> 00:12:17.337
...to use your image on a
video documentary?

00:12:17.755 --> 00:12:19.757
I don't care about that, but...

00:12:20.007 --> 00:12:21.759
You have to say yes or no, sir,

00:12:21.925 --> 00:12:23.260
- Watch it.
- I'm sorry.

00:12:23.427 --> 00:12:24.178
Yeah, sure, okay.

00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:28.098
Some girl, in the late 1800's...

00:12:28.599 --> 00:12:30.851
...Robin Weaver, I
believe her name was, ...

00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:35.022
...supposedly wandered
off into the woods.

00:12:35.439 --> 00:12:38.358
No "supposedly" about it.
She wandered off!

00:12:38.776 --> 00:12:40.527
- Okay, wandered off.
- And got lost.

00:12:40.694 --> 00:12:41.779
She got lost.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.031
Wasn't no "supposedly".

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:46.283
Three days later...

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.703
...she appears back on her
grandmother's porch.

00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:53.540
And everybody's mystified.

00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:56.460
- She was babbling something...
- Her story.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.879
Babbling something about...

00:12:59.129 --> 00:13:01.715
...an old woman whose feet
never touched the ground.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.221
I saw... just by that
tree up the creek...

00:13:08.305 --> 00:13:09.723
...about a hundred yards,

00:13:10.307 --> 00:13:14.228
I saw a white misty thing.
Can't tell you what it was.

00:13:14.394 --> 00:13:17.564
Like grey vapor rising
out of the trees.

00:13:17.815 --> 00:13:19.233
Right out of the water.

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:20.317
Right out of the water?

00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:22.903
Up the side of the trees,
Then it disappeared.

00:13:23.153 --> 00:13:24.571
You're full of it.

00:13:24.738 --> 00:13:26.907
I'm not. And I wasn't
drinking that day, either.

00:13:27.157 --> 00:13:27.908
Sure you weren't.

00:13:28.158 --> 00:13:30.077
How is that related to the
story of Coffin Rock?

00:13:30.327 --> 00:13:32.830
It all ties in to the
story of Coffin Rock.

00:13:32.996 --> 00:13:33.664
How's that?

00:13:35.082 --> 00:13:38.168
Anybody round here...

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:41.421
...knows that the old woman has
haunted this area for years.

00:13:41.672 --> 00:13:43.006
That's bullshit.

00:13:45.842 --> 00:13:47.761
These woods are thick.

00:13:48.428 --> 00:13:49.680
You excited?

00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:51.598
You got it.

00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:55.269
I hope he's not shooting a
whole shitload of stock.

00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:19.793
I could help, but I'd
rather record.

00:14:20.043 --> 00:14:20.794
Okay.

00:14:21.044 --> 00:14:23.797
Packs on, we're ready to go.

00:14:23.964 --> 00:14:25.882
We gotta go up to the shack?

00:14:26.049 --> 00:14:26.800
Yeah.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.059
My God, this is a very heavy pack.

00:14:39.646 --> 00:14:41.565
Off to Coffin Rock.

00:14:41.732 --> 00:14:43.734
I know exactly where we are now.

00:14:44.735 --> 00:14:45.902
Mikey, give me the video camera.

00:14:46.153 --> 00:14:48.322
I wanna get her going across, man.

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:54.161
I see a dirty behind.

00:14:58.332 --> 00:14:59.333
Good jump.

00:14:59.583 --> 00:15:00.167
Thank you.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.002
There it is. See?

00:15:04.254 --> 00:15:05.422
That's Coffin Rock.

00:15:10.093 --> 00:15:12.512
"They went into the woods
ready to find death...

00:15:12.679 --> 00:15:14.681
...but what they found
was inhumane...

00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:17.768
...at the site called Coffin Rock.

00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:20.604
...up on the rock, the torture...

00:15:21.188 --> 00:15:24.107
...suffered by these five
brave men was obvious...

00:15:24.274 --> 00:15:28.278
...they were tied up, one man's
hands tied to the next man's feet...

00:15:28.528 --> 00:15:30.447
...forming a solid
human structure...

00:15:30.614 --> 00:15:33.617
...blood indicated that
it had happened...

00:15:33.784 --> 00:15:36.536
...while they were
alive and resisting...

00:15:36.787 --> 00:15:40.207
...their intestines had been
crudely torn out...

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.461
...and on each of their faces there
was indecipherable writing...

00:15:44.628 --> 00:15:46.713
...cut into their flesh
with precision...

00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:49.716
...the men, shocked by
what had happened...

00:15:49.883 --> 00:15:51.718
...went to find the sheriff...

00:15:51.885 --> 00:15:55.222
...without sketching the writing
or touching the bodies...

00:15:55.388 --> 00:15:57.474
...they returned to see
vultures at the rock.

00:15:57.641 --> 00:16:01.561
But the bodies had been
removed by persons unknown...

00:16:01.812 --> 00:16:04.731
...the stench of death
was still thick...

00:16:04.981 --> 00:16:08.401
...but the bodies had been
taken in a matter of hours..."

00:16:09.653 --> 00:16:13.073
That happened here
at Coffin Rock.

00:16:15.075 --> 00:16:18.578
Let's rush, because I want
to camp, and it's 4:52.

00:16:18.745 --> 00:16:21.665
It's late. We're gonna be
losing light soon.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:26.586
But I can use the shot
without me in it...

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.924
...because I recorded sound
while reading the whole thing, ...

00:16:31.508 --> 00:16:33.677
...so I'm sure I can edit
it together somehow.

00:16:38.181 --> 00:16:39.432
It's starting to rain.

00:16:40.183 --> 00:16:41.184
Did you rent this thing?

00:16:41.434 --> 00:16:45.105
Yeah. I don't have a
tent for three people.

00:16:45.605 --> 00:16:46.690
Just wondering...

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.942
I don't usually travel with two men.

00:16:49.359 --> 00:16:52.946
It is pouring with rain.
Can't even light a fire.

00:16:53.363 --> 00:16:55.448
Show us what the stick is for.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.453
Look. We've got our
very own leaning post.

00:17:00.954 --> 00:17:03.790
If it smells of farts
too much in the night...

00:17:04.207 --> 00:17:06.459
Okay, so I can't have a
cigarette in the tent, ...

00:17:06.877 --> 00:17:08.878
...but he can fart as
much as he wants?

00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:12.799
No, I never gave Mike
a fart allowance.

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:15.218
You heard noises last night?

00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:17.887
- I did.
- Problem is, I sleep like a log.

00:17:18.138 --> 00:17:20.473
There were two separate noises...

00:17:20.724 --> 00:17:23.643
...coming from two
areas over here...

00:17:24.477 --> 00:17:26.313
...one of them could
have been an owl...

00:17:26.563 --> 00:17:28.732
...but the other was a cackling.

00:17:30.066 --> 00:17:31.151
No way.

00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:32.986
It was a cackling, man.

00:17:33.236 --> 00:17:35.572
If I heard a cackling,
I would've shit myself.

00:17:36.239 --> 00:17:37.991
Where did we start yesterday?

00:17:38.325 --> 00:17:39.826
Off the map.

00:17:40.577 --> 00:17:44.414
I knew where we were going.
There was some confusion, but today...

00:17:44.581 --> 00:17:45.915
Wait, ... say that again.

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:48.335
I said I knew where
we were going.

00:17:48.585 --> 00:17:51.588
Wait, ... was that a
full of shit statement?

00:17:51.755 --> 00:17:52.422
No, it wasn't.

00:17:52.589 --> 00:17:54.591
- So that wasn't bullshit?
- I knew where we were going.

00:17:54.758 --> 00:17:56.926
You got us lost, man.

00:17:57.093 --> 00:17:59.012
For a very short period of time.

00:17:59.512 --> 00:18:01.181
Just don't get us lost today.

00:18:01.348 --> 00:18:02.015
Yeah, seriously.

00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:04.017
No. These places are
very well documented.

00:18:04.184 --> 00:18:06.269
You happy with the documentary?

00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:07.437
Yes, I am.

00:18:08.438 --> 00:18:11.274
I'm very pleasantly surprised
by our little Mikey.

00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:12.609
"Our Little Mikey?"

00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:14.194
Our Little Mikey...

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.115
...a very spirited young man.

00:18:19.616 --> 00:18:22.369
What do you think about the
witch? You think she exists?

00:18:22.702 --> 00:18:24.371
I don't know.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.334
Heather, I really hope
you find us a trail.

00:18:29.626 --> 00:18:32.462
There's a trail up on
this hill. Don't worry.

00:18:34.881 --> 00:18:36.758
We like shortcuts, don't we?

00:18:39.052 --> 00:18:41.179
We like level shortcuts.

00:18:42.055 --> 00:18:43.932
Not mountain shortcuts.

00:18:44.224 --> 00:18:46.726
It's the first time we've
seen Mike's chest.

00:18:46.893 --> 00:18:49.145
It's really hard to film on video.

00:18:49.646 --> 00:18:52.232
He has really sporadic hair
patterns on his chest.

00:18:52.398 --> 00:18:53.316
Like symbols.

00:18:53.483 --> 00:18:55.985
It's like blank... hairy...

00:18:56.402 --> 00:18:58.071
...blank... hairy.

00:18:58.321 --> 00:18:59.239
You should see my ass.

00:18:59.489 --> 00:19:01.241
Look, here's fucking Uruguay.

00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:04.577
- And there's Paraguay.
- Yeah.

00:19:04.911 --> 00:19:06.246
I think I see Bolivia.

00:19:06.454 --> 00:19:10.250
What killed this
mouse? Witchcraft?

00:19:12.585 --> 00:19:13.920
How 'bout God?

00:19:15.171 --> 00:19:16.756
Is that the Blair Witch?

00:19:17.173 --> 00:19:21.594
No. I think it's Heather,
taking a piss.

00:19:22.679 --> 00:19:25.765
You know, I
really have to go.

00:19:27.058 --> 00:19:28.518
Ohhh... go!

00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:33.106
We're near the cemetery
trail. It should only be...

00:19:33.439 --> 00:19:35.191
- What?
- Says who?

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.442
Says me, of course.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.197
We should be there
in about ninety minutes.

00:19:43.533 --> 00:19:44.784
You guys cool with that?

00:19:45.618 --> 00:19:46.286
What?

00:19:46.452 --> 00:19:47.537
Ninety minutes?

00:19:47.787 --> 00:19:50.373
- If you know where we're going.
- Sure.

00:19:50.665 --> 00:19:52.542
Josh wants to look at the map now.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.627
Though I know
where we're going.

00:19:54.836 --> 00:19:57.130
If you'd known where
we were, we wouldn't be...

00:19:57.297 --> 00:19:58.381
We're in the middle
of the fucking woods.

00:19:58.548 --> 00:20:01.134
- How could you possibly know?
- Because some is off trail.

00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:03.970
What, somebody told you
there's a cemetery back there?

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.639
If we're lost, admit that, because...

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.057
...I know we're not lost.

00:20:08.308 --> 00:20:10.602
You knew that yesterday, too,
and twice again today.

00:20:10.727 --> 00:20:13.730
Bullshit! We have
not been lost today.

00:20:14.564 --> 00:20:15.899
Not once.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.108
Okay, this is where we were.

00:20:17.317 --> 00:20:19.903
You said that it was
two miles away.

00:20:20.069 --> 00:20:21.988
Then it's two hours away,
three hours away...

00:20:22.196 --> 00:20:24.741
- Okay, just chill!
- Maybe it's four hours away.

00:20:24.949 --> 00:20:27.744
- You agreed to do this project.
- I agreed to a scouted-out project.

00:20:27.952 --> 00:20:30.747
- Not to wander round the woods.
- I told you that...

00:20:30.997 --> 00:20:33.333
...getting to the locations
wasn't gonna be easy.

00:20:33.583 --> 00:20:35.418
Mike, Mike... Okay, guys!

00:20:35.585 --> 00:20:37.754
Please, you're being a smart-ass.

00:20:37.962 --> 00:20:39.255
We're looking at the map...

00:20:39.422 --> 00:20:42.008
...we'll find this the best we can.

00:20:42.258 --> 00:20:46.012
This is where we were. We're
going more or less this way.

00:20:46.763 --> 00:20:49.432
Okay, what do you say? Where
do you think we're going?

00:20:50.183 --> 00:20:51.392
To tell you the truth...

00:20:55.688 --> 00:20:58.524
...this is Greek
to me. It's useless.

00:20:58.691 --> 00:20:59.525
Exactly.

00:20:59.734 --> 00:21:01.319
So I'm putting my trust in you...

00:21:01.444 --> 00:21:04.447
...that you know where it is.

00:21:05.281 --> 00:21:06.199
Good.

00:21:07.408 --> 00:21:09.952
Though I gotta tell you,
I don't fully trust you...

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.121
...and I...

00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:13.831
What?

00:21:14.123 --> 00:21:16.959
I don't know why you tape
every conversation, man.

00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:18.252
Well, we're making a documentary.

00:21:18.461 --> 00:21:21.547
Not about us getting lost,
it's about a witch!

00:21:22.924 --> 00:21:24.300
I have a camera.

00:21:24.967 --> 00:21:28.888
We'll all look back on this
and laugh, believe me.

00:21:29.389 --> 00:21:31.391
Baby steps, man, baby steps.

00:21:31.557 --> 00:21:34.811
Just breathe and don't look down.
No, you gotta look down.

00:21:34.977 --> 00:21:36.396
Are you gonna have to crawl?

00:21:36.562 --> 00:21:37.146
I'm gonna crawl.

00:21:37.313 --> 00:21:37.939
Cool.

00:21:38.064 --> 00:21:41.651
Think how cool the fucking
cemetery is gonna be.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.656
Think of the joy of being
in a really good film.

00:21:46.823 --> 00:21:47.657
Okay, shut the fuck up.

00:21:47.824 --> 00:21:49.075
Okay, I'm quiet.

00:21:49.283 --> 00:21:50.451
Shit. How am I gonna do this?

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.787
Okay... Mikey?

00:21:52.995 --> 00:21:53.579
Yeah.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.500
Dude, don't come across
with the DAT on your belly.

00:21:57.834 --> 00:21:58.668
No way, man.

00:21:58.835 --> 00:22:00.086
There's no chance.

00:22:00.586 --> 00:22:02.338
How do we get it
across?

00:22:02.505 --> 00:22:03.423
It's really fucking hard.

00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:04.841
How we gonna get
it across?

00:22:05.049 --> 00:22:08.344
The moss this morning was easy.
This stuff's slippery as shit.

00:22:09.262 --> 00:22:11.013
Well, how do we get
the DAT across?

00:22:12.515 --> 00:22:15.601
I don't know. Let
me put my pack down...

00:22:15.768 --> 00:22:17.520
I'll just go back and forth, man.

00:22:17.687 --> 00:22:19.772
Can you do it that way?

00:22:20.022 --> 00:22:21.440
It's the only thing I can do.

00:22:21.607 --> 00:22:23.025
Okay, we'll do it like that.

00:22:23.276 --> 00:22:24.318
Oh, Christ!

00:22:24.527 --> 00:22:26.404
Oh, what'd you drop?

00:22:26.654 --> 00:22:30.449
Nothing.
The tree just broke.

00:22:30.616 --> 00:22:31.701
Oh, fuck.

00:22:31.951 --> 00:22:33.953
We're very, very close now.

00:22:36.622 --> 00:22:38.124
You guys excited?

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.295
Okay.

00:22:42.962 --> 00:22:44.380
What's this?

00:22:51.888 --> 00:22:54.640
What's this? Dude, guys.

00:22:56.309 --> 00:22:58.853
Remember what Mary
Brown said the other day?

00:23:00.646 --> 00:23:03.316
What story from the
Bible was she telling us?

00:23:03.566 --> 00:23:05.818
Fuck, I wasn't listening, I
thought she was crazy.

00:23:06.402 --> 00:23:09.238
It was Esau, something about a
pile of rocks.

00:23:09.989 --> 00:23:12.575
She was talking
about her rocks, man.

00:23:12.825 --> 00:23:14.994
Well, what about
the rocks?

00:23:16.412 --> 00:23:18.247
Anybody remember?

00:23:19.498 --> 00:23:22.919
To live your life.

00:23:24.253 --> 00:23:26.505
Looks like an Indian
burial ground, man.

00:23:26.756 --> 00:23:28.758
I don't know if this counts,
three...

00:23:30.843 --> 00:23:31.761
...four...

00:23:34.263 --> 00:23:35.181
...five...

00:23:36.265 --> 00:23:37.266
...six...

00:23:38.768 --> 00:23:39.685
...seven.

00:23:39.936 --> 00:23:41.604
Years ago witches
were roasted...

00:23:41.854 --> 00:23:43.856
...just like my Vienna sausage.

00:23:44.523 --> 00:23:47.360
Flames are licking you
like the Devil, Josh.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:51.030
Sit back and hear a tale,
a tale of a fateful trip...

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.532
...that started on
this desert isle...

00:23:53.699 --> 00:23:55.618
...aboard this tiny ship...

00:23:55.785 --> 00:23:57.870
Yeah, but this ship
has a good captain...

00:23:58.037 --> 00:24:00.456
...not a beer-guzzling
guy in a blue shirt.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.291
He wasn't beer-guzzling.

00:24:02.792 --> 00:24:04.877
They had no beer on
the island, man.

00:24:05.044 --> 00:24:08.047
If they had beer, they'd
have had big-ass orgies.

00:24:09.465 --> 00:24:12.635
You're like the Captain,
and Mike's your Gilligan.

00:24:13.135 --> 00:24:14.637
- No offense.
- That's all right.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.305
It was a compliment...

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.392
...Gilligan was a funny guy...

00:24:19.642 --> 00:24:21.811
...the Captain was fat, though.

00:24:21.977 --> 00:24:24.230
Well okay, let's call
it a thin Captain.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.981
It's not Captain...

00:24:26.232 --> 00:24:28.651
It's the Skipper.

00:24:30.403 --> 00:24:31.570
No more Captain.

00:24:33.489 --> 00:24:36.158
Here we are back at
the rock again...

00:24:36.325 --> 00:24:38.077
...the cemetery deal.

00:24:39.829 --> 00:24:41.997
I just wanna be careful
not to get in the shot.

00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:52.258
It certainly is odd.

00:24:58.764 --> 00:25:01.684
Please tell me you didn't
just knock that over.

00:25:01.934 --> 00:25:03.436
I didn't just knock that over.

00:25:03.686 --> 00:25:07.690
That's not very nice.
Let me put it back.

00:25:16.031 --> 00:25:17.783
You can't be too careful.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.535
What'd you think?

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:23.873
It was the same, only darker.

00:25:24.457 --> 00:25:26.125
Yeah, pretty much.

00:25:27.376 --> 00:25:29.879
All right. Bag it up.

00:25:30.713 --> 00:25:31.714
Hello?

00:25:33.215 --> 00:25:34.884
Shit, no light.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.225
We were sleeping.

00:25:43.392 --> 00:25:44.310
Do you want this?

00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:47.313
Put it by the tent door.

00:26:01.327 --> 00:26:02.494
Listen.

00:26:04.079 --> 00:26:05.080
Hello?

00:26:06.832 --> 00:26:07.833
Hello!

00:26:15.507 --> 00:26:19.094
It's all around us.
Fucking weird.

00:26:19.762 --> 00:26:21.597
Michael, aren't you
coming down?

00:26:22.014 --> 00:26:23.098
I ain't going down there.

00:26:23.432 --> 00:26:24.600
Why not?

00:26:24.767 --> 00:26:26.518
- Because I don't hear shit.
- You're fucking scared.

00:26:26.685 --> 00:26:27.853
Because I don't
hear anything!

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.272
You cannot deny hearing it.

00:26:31.273 --> 00:26:33.192
Get your ass out! Come on!

00:26:35.527 --> 00:26:37.613
This rain fucking blows, man.

00:26:37.863 --> 00:26:39.782
I know. It's raining heavily.

00:26:40.449 --> 00:26:43.953
Thanks mom for giving me
rain gear for my birthday.

00:26:44.203 --> 00:26:45.788
God bless her.

00:26:46.038 --> 00:26:47.957
What do you think it
was last night?

00:26:49.375 --> 00:26:50.876
Personally?

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.543
Yeah.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.963
Someone fucking
with your head.

00:26:54.129 --> 00:26:55.965
But nobody knows
we're here.

00:26:56.131 --> 00:26:58.634
Yeah, but... you ever see
"Deliverance"?

00:26:59.134 --> 00:27:02.638
Well, whatever it was,
I just wanted to...

00:27:02.805 --> 00:27:04.974
You were freaking out.
You bugged me out.

00:27:05.224 --> 00:27:08.227
I was. I woke up suddenly
and shit's going down...

00:27:08.394 --> 00:27:09.979
...and all I can think is
"I want it all...

00:27:10.229 --> 00:27:12.898
I want it on sound,
I want it on sixteen.

00:27:13.065 --> 00:27:15.818
If we see anything,
I want it on sixteen."

00:27:16.318 --> 00:27:19.405
Sounded to me like a lot
of people running around...

00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:21.573
...maybe they were locals
or whatever.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.659
I don't know what
the hell they wanted.

00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:27.913
We're deep in the woods, and
if people want to mess with us...

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.165
...then there's something
wrong with them...

00:27:30.332 --> 00:27:31.750
...and I'm not gonna
get into that.

00:27:31.917 --> 00:27:33.085
And if it wasn't people?

00:27:33.335 --> 00:27:35.170
Well, I'm not gonna
get into that, either!

00:27:36.755 --> 00:27:37.756
Fuck, man...

00:27:39.758 --> 00:27:41.593
... it's been a very long day...

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.596
...a very wet, very long day.

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:51.019
Nobody's speaking to me
right now.

00:27:51.603 --> 00:27:54.189
Dude, I don't remember
any of this.

00:27:55.107 --> 00:27:56.275
What?

00:27:56.442 --> 00:27:59.194
I don't remember any
of this coming from the car.

00:27:59.361 --> 00:28:03.198
We have to go a different
route to get back...

00:28:03.449 --> 00:28:05.451
...because we went
around in a curve.

00:28:07.953 --> 00:28:10.122
Two more hours max, guys.

00:28:12.207 --> 00:28:16.128
If we came by a short cut, why
are we going back a different way?

00:28:17.963 --> 00:28:19.965
Because we have to go round...

00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:23.051
It was the most direct way to
hit our two locations.

00:28:23.552 --> 00:28:25.220
And this is the quickest
way back to the car.

00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:26.388
Seriously?

00:28:26.555 --> 00:28:27.973
Yes. Seriously.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.059
- You know exactly what's going on?
- Yes. Let's just keep going.

00:28:31.226 --> 00:28:32.311
All right.

00:28:33.228 --> 00:28:35.481
Five minutes and we
do a map check.

00:28:35.981 --> 00:28:37.065
All right.

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:41.653
We just did a map check,
and we're still on track.

00:28:42.488 --> 00:28:43.989
That's not what I said.

00:28:44.823 --> 00:28:47.075
We're all right. Come on,
just keep going.

00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:52.831
Well the compass says...

00:28:53.081 --> 00:28:55.250
...we go straight ahead,
that way.

00:28:56.001 --> 00:28:58.086
We're in the middle of nowhere.

00:28:58.503 --> 00:29:01.006
We've been in the middle
of nowhere for two days.

00:29:01.173 --> 00:29:02.925
Just like the car.

00:29:03.091 --> 00:29:05.761
Look at this shit, man!
This is nothing.

00:29:07.179 --> 00:29:09.181
Let's just keep
going, all right?

00:29:12.184 --> 00:29:13.602
I think we should camp.

00:29:13.769 --> 00:29:14.853
Get the fuck out of here!

00:29:15.103 --> 00:29:17.105
Why? 'Cause you don't know
where we are?

00:29:17.272 --> 00:29:19.358
No, because we're still
A little way from the car...

00:29:19.524 --> 00:29:20.859
...and it's gonna be dark soon.

00:29:22.277 --> 00:29:25.614
- Look, I'm not sure...
- We don't camp. Stop the camera...

00:29:25.781 --> 00:29:26.865
...and get us home.

00:29:27.032 --> 00:29:30.452
Turn the camera off and give
me the fucking map.

00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:32.120
Turn it off and get us home.

00:29:32.287 --> 00:29:35.457
No, I'm filming. I want
to mark this occasion.

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:36.708
Give me the map.

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:39.795
The map is in my
pocket. Wait a second.

00:29:39.962 --> 00:29:41.213
God damn!

00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:45.050
If we keep our heads
together, we'll be just fine.

00:29:45.217 --> 00:29:46.718
Fucking bullshit!

00:29:46.885 --> 00:29:47.970
Mike, chill.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:49.721
Just relax, Mike.

00:29:49.972 --> 00:29:51.974
Don't fucking tell
me to relax!

00:29:52.557 --> 00:29:55.644
Let's just sit down,
and check the map...

00:29:55.811 --> 00:29:57.813
Yes. Let's do that, please.

00:29:59.231 --> 00:30:00.565
Are you happy?

00:30:00.732 --> 00:30:02.067
I'm not happy, no.

00:30:02.901 --> 00:30:05.904
But the car isn't far. But we
can't find it in the dark.

00:30:06.071 --> 00:30:08.824
Are you absolutely sure?

00:30:09.074 --> 00:30:12.911
Yes. I'm so sorry. We can still
get the DAT back tomorrow.

00:30:12.995 --> 00:30:14.246
We have to...

00:30:14.496 --> 00:30:17.833
We will get the
DAT back on time.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.418
And the camera.

00:30:19.584 --> 00:30:21.086
We'll get it all
back tomorrow.

00:30:21.253 --> 00:30:23.588
I start work tomorrow at nine.

00:30:23.839 --> 00:30:24.840
I know.

00:30:25.007 --> 00:30:27.009
It's fine. Let's go to sleep.

00:30:27.175 --> 00:30:29.344
Let's just fucking camp, okay?

00:30:29.761 --> 00:30:31.930
I wanna tape it from
inside the tent.

00:30:37.686 --> 00:30:40.689
Whatever it is, it sounds the
same as last night.

00:30:48.113 --> 00:30:50.949
Where's my boots? Fuck, it's cold...

00:30:55.871 --> 00:30:56.788
Hello?

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:03.628
Shit, it's fucking freezing...

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.881
...there.

00:31:07.048 --> 00:31:07.966
What?

00:31:08.216 --> 00:31:09.301
I hear it.

00:31:09.885 --> 00:31:11.303
I don't hear shit.

00:31:12.387 --> 00:31:13.805
You hear that?

00:31:20.061 --> 00:31:20.979
Shit...

00:31:31.323 --> 00:31:32.407
Hello?

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.439
I think it's just a deer.

00:32:05.524 --> 00:32:08.026
- Could be deer, I guess.
- It's just a deer.

00:32:08.276 --> 00:32:09.861
I don't think so, man.

00:32:09.945 --> 00:32:13.114
Sounds just like last night.
It's all around us.

00:32:13.365 --> 00:32:14.616
It's gotta be just a deer.

00:32:14.783 --> 00:32:16.201
It was a deer, man.

00:32:17.202 --> 00:32:18.787
It wasn't like last night.

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:25.961
You say something?

00:32:26.127 --> 00:32:29.714
Yes! Fucking listen! Let's
get it on DAT... be quiet...

00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:31.299
Okay, it's on.

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:37.806
Jesus Christ! What the
fuck was that?

00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:46.898
It's not scared by our yelling.

00:32:51.987 --> 00:32:53.655
Sounds like footsteps.

00:32:53.905 --> 00:32:55.907
I know! It's a fucking person!

00:32:57.575 --> 00:33:00.745
I don't see shit on video.
We'll just use DAT, right?

00:33:00.996 --> 00:33:01.830
But I'm staying out.

00:33:01.997 --> 00:33:03.331
You stay out here with me.

00:33:03.498 --> 00:33:04.582
I am. I am.

00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:08.837
What time is it? Anywhere
near morning?

00:33:09.838 --> 00:33:10.505
Let me see...

00:33:10.672 --> 00:33:13.258
Tell me it's five
O'clock or something.

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:15.510
Three.

00:33:15.677 --> 00:33:16.511
Fuck!

00:33:18.013 --> 00:33:21.182
Bullshit. This is
fucking crazy.

00:33:23.018 --> 00:33:25.603
I'm sorry, Mike. We should
be home already.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.856
This has got nothing to do...

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.692
...with what we're here for.

00:33:30.942 --> 00:33:32.777
This is just it's bullshit.

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:36.698
Woke up this morning,
two seconds ago...

00:33:37.365 --> 00:33:40.035
...and there are piles of
rocks outside our tent.

00:33:43.872 --> 00:33:45.707
There are three, actually.

00:33:47.375 --> 00:33:50.295
Are you positive those
weren't there last night?

00:33:50.545 --> 00:33:53.381
I am fucking positive
they weren't here!

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:56.051
How could we have
just camped...

00:33:56.217 --> 00:33:59.554
...between three piles of rocks
just by coincidence?

00:34:00.305 --> 00:34:01.973
You don't think this is strange?

00:34:02.557 --> 00:34:06.060
It is fucking weird, but
I really don't care...

00:34:06.227 --> 00:34:08.813
...because all I want to do
is get to the goddam car.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.066
Whatever it is,
man, right now...

00:34:12.484 --> 00:34:14.235
...we have to get back to the car.

00:34:14.486 --> 00:34:17.322
They obviously don't want us
Here, so let's get out.

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:19.991
We have to get the DAT back.

00:34:20.241 --> 00:34:22.577
- That's what I mean.
- Okay, let's go.

00:34:22.744 --> 00:34:25.663
Let's pack our shit up
and just walk.

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:27.081
Can we just walk?

00:34:27.332 --> 00:34:28.249
Yes, we're out of here.

00:34:28.416 --> 00:34:29.250
Okay, cool.

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:32.420
But we're leaving just
when it's all happening.

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:36.674
Put the fucking camera down.
Let's pack up the tent.

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:39.010
- Let's get out of the woods.
- Okay, hang on.

00:34:39.928 --> 00:34:40.678
Come on!

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:43.848
No, I'm not scared!
I'm just tired and hungry...

00:34:44.015 --> 00:34:47.185
I'm just fucking done, man.

00:34:47.352 --> 00:34:48.269
All right.

00:34:51.272 --> 00:34:52.524
Did you take it?

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:55.693
No, I didn't take the fucking map.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.949
I'm not playing head games.

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:03.284
You're the one playing
head games.

00:35:03.451 --> 00:35:04.869
But I'm not.

00:35:06.538 --> 00:35:10.625
I don't have it. We have to go.
I'm serious, I don't have it.

00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:11.876
Are you fucking serious?

00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:14.045
Fucking serious. I don't have it.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:17.382
Heather, that is not so cool, man.

00:35:17.549 --> 00:35:19.300
I know it's not cool!

00:35:20.802 --> 00:35:22.303
It's the fucking least
responsible thing...

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.889
...you could have done, man.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:26.808
I know that.

00:35:29.143 --> 00:35:30.728
You really don't have it?

00:35:32.647 --> 00:35:34.315
One of you must have the map.

00:35:34.482 --> 00:35:36.901
No, I don't have the map.
We gave it back to you...

00:35:37.151 --> 00:35:39.153
...after map check yesterday.

00:35:39.988 --> 00:35:42.240
I always keep it in the
same place...

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:44.409
...and if it's not there,
one of you must have it.

00:35:44.659 --> 00:35:47.912
I did not get the goddam map
out of your fucking pants, man.

00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:50.164
Well, I don't have it!

00:35:50.331 --> 00:35:51.666
Look, why would I take it?

00:35:51.833 --> 00:35:54.168
I just wanna get out
of here, man.

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.336
Me too.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:56.421
Let's go!

00:35:56.546 --> 00:36:00.008
No, you wanna stay and
film rocks, look around...

00:36:00.174 --> 00:36:00.842
Let's go!

00:36:00.967 --> 00:36:03.177
...you wanna film this and that...
Which way?

00:36:03.344 --> 00:36:04.012
That way.

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:06.014
We're in the
middle of the woods!

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.516
We can walk any way!

00:36:08.683 --> 00:36:11.936
This way! Because we've
been going this way all day.

00:36:12.186 --> 00:36:14.939
We're going this way!
We gotta find something!

00:36:15.565 --> 00:36:17.191
I gave you back the map!

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.026
I gave you the map.

00:36:18.276 --> 00:36:20.445
I gave you back the map!

00:36:21.571 --> 00:36:23.906
- Let's just go.
- We can move as fast as we want...

00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:26.868
...but there's no point if we have
no idea where we're going.

00:36:27.201 --> 00:36:29.370
We're following the creek.
Mike seems happy with that.

00:36:29.537 --> 00:36:30.788
Would you guys stop it?

00:36:38.629 --> 00:36:40.840
We are fucked, we are done...

00:36:41.049 --> 00:36:43.384
...we are dead, we are fucked.

00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:51.392
I'm staying here. When you
find someone...

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:54.812
...tell them I'm under the
tree with the vine.

00:36:55.063 --> 00:36:56.564
All blame aside...

00:36:59.484 --> 00:37:01.152
...this is really fucked up.

00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:03.654
I know.

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:06.574
We really need to work together.

00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:08.910
- I realize that.
- Exactly. Exactly.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.330
So we accept the fact that my
camera's not gonna be back...

00:37:12.497 --> 00:37:13.706
...or your DAT.

00:37:13.998 --> 00:37:16.542
No blame from now
on about that shit.

00:37:16.918 --> 00:37:17.752
Look, seriously...

00:37:18.503 --> 00:37:21.255
...this area's not that fucking big.

00:37:21.506 --> 00:37:25.259
Exactly. It's very hard to get
lost in America these days...

00:37:25.593 --> 00:37:28.513
...and even harder to stay lost.

00:37:28.805 --> 00:37:29.597
What?

00:37:30.431 --> 00:37:32.934
Well, we're doin' a pretty good
job of being lost.

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:36.896
If you're not home today,
and I'm not home today...

00:37:37.146 --> 00:37:38.731
...people are gonna notice...

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.776
...My girlfriend's definitely
gonna notice...

00:37:42.276 --> 00:37:45.029
...and she'll notice that
I haven't called.

00:37:47.198 --> 00:37:50.034
...that I didn't get back and
I didn't call...

00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:51.869
...so if by tonight we
haven't found shit...

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:54.789
...someone's gonna be looking for us.

00:37:54.956 --> 00:37:55.873
Oh, no!

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.792
Not down here, go another way...

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.127
...I just got my whole shit wet.

00:38:03.631 --> 00:38:06.634
Shit. Well, let's try it this way.

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:09.303
No, not this way...

00:38:10.513 --> 00:38:12.598
...better try the other way.

00:38:14.934 --> 00:38:18.062
- If we didn't have these packs...
- I don't mean to laugh...

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.314
Your feet are wet!

00:38:20.481 --> 00:38:22.233
Is Michael laughing?

00:38:25.486 --> 00:38:27.572
Shut up and cross the stream.

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:29.490
He's laughing...

00:38:29.657 --> 00:38:32.577
...that's the first time
you've laughed in days.

00:38:37.081 --> 00:38:40.084
I'm happy you
find it amusing...

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:42.587
...that I'll be uncomfortable
for the rest of the day.

00:38:43.379 --> 00:38:45.464
Dude, uncomfort does not even...

00:38:46.591 --> 00:38:47.800
Can we keep going, please?

00:38:48.175 --> 00:38:50.261
No, we're gonna chill out!

00:38:52.013 --> 00:38:55.099
- Didn't you want to get to the car?
- Oh boy!!

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.184
Okay, come on... let's get up here.

00:38:57.351 --> 00:38:58.436
Oh shit.

00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:02.148
You weren't lying to me about
the map, were you?

00:39:02.398 --> 00:39:06.193
'Cause to me it seems like you're
having a little too much fun.

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:08.279
- Oh, Heather...
- We're going a little stir crazy.

00:39:08.612 --> 00:39:11.615
Heather! If you make me
yell at this point...

00:39:12.033 --> 00:39:13.617
...don't make me
yell at you, man.

00:39:13.868 --> 00:39:17.371
Seriously, if you got the map, I
just wanna know you have it!

00:39:18.205 --> 00:39:20.958
That would make me happy,
just to know you have it.

00:39:22.209 --> 00:39:26.130
If I knew that, and I could see
it, I'd feel much better.

00:39:30.301 --> 00:39:32.219
We're just trying to
be cool with you.

00:39:32.386 --> 00:39:35.765
So I get laughed at 'cause
my shoes got wet.

00:39:36.015 --> 00:39:37.391
It's fucking hilarious.

00:39:41.562 --> 00:39:43.481
All our shoes are wet...

00:39:43.647 --> 00:39:46.067
...we were laughing
at the situation.

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:46.984
Fine.

00:39:47.234 --> 00:39:49.153
We're fucking hungry
and fucking tired...

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.156
- ...what the hell else can we do?
- You know what?

00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:54.784
I'm sorry, it's fucked up...

00:39:57.119 --> 00:40:00.790
...but I kicked that map into the
creek yesterday.

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:04.960
It was useless and I kicked it
into the creek!

00:40:09.256 --> 00:40:10.841
I fucking hope he's kidding.

00:40:12.343 --> 00:40:13.177
Mike?

00:40:14.762 --> 00:40:16.430
I really fucking hope he's kidding.

00:40:18.265 --> 00:40:19.600
Mike, are you fucking kidding?

00:40:19.809 --> 00:40:21.519
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

00:40:21.685 --> 00:40:25.106
You're kidding me. You have
gotta be fucking kidding me!

00:40:25.606 --> 00:40:27.274
- You think it's a game?
- Get off me!

00:40:27.441 --> 00:40:29.443
What the fuck?
Are you out of your mind?

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:32.071
No, I'm not. That map
wasn't doing shit!

00:40:32.279 --> 00:40:35.533
Not for you, but I knew what
the fuck the map said!!

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:36.534
I'm sorry!

00:40:36.742 --> 00:40:38.577
You're a fucking asshole!

00:40:38.828 --> 00:40:39.620
I'm sorry.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:41.205
You're a fucking asshole!

00:40:41.455 --> 00:40:43.707
That map was useless!

00:40:43.874 --> 00:40:46.669
If we get hurt or die here,
it's your fucking fault!

00:40:46.919 --> 00:40:49.255
You understand?

00:40:51.715 --> 00:40:54.218
How could you be
such an asshole?

00:40:55.386 --> 00:40:58.806
- What were you thinking?
- You are fucking me up here!

00:40:59.139 --> 00:41:01.976
I am not! That map
was useless!

00:41:02.893 --> 00:41:04.311
It was useless to you!

00:41:04.979 --> 00:41:07.731
Okay...

00:41:08.065 --> 00:41:10.317
I didn't bring you out
here for this, man.

00:41:10.734 --> 00:41:14.029
Sorry about the map, man.
What can I say?

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:18.200
- The map wasn't doing shit.
- Just don't say sorry.

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:19.910
It wasn't worth
shit to you.

00:41:20.077 --> 00:41:23.080
I knew exactly where
we were!

00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:26.083
Listen! Yesterday I asked you what
fucking river we were on...

00:41:26.292 --> 00:41:27.585
Shut up or else.

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:29.336
Turn the fucking camera off!

00:41:29.503 --> 00:41:30.588
Give me the compass...

00:41:32.298 --> 00:41:34.341
...you have betrayed us...

00:41:34.633 --> 00:41:37.761
...way fucking beyond.
Give me the compass.

00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:40.347
So have you for not getting
us out of the woods.

00:41:40.514 --> 00:41:41.765
Yeah, thanks.

00:41:43.225 --> 00:41:45.185
Can I have the fucking compass?

00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:49.607
No. I bought the compass.
If you wanted one...

00:41:49.857 --> 00:41:51.317
...you should've
bought your own.

00:41:51.567 --> 00:41:53.360
You and he both fucked us up.

00:41:53.652 --> 00:41:55.237
Why can't you admit that...

00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:57.865
- ...you fucked up from the start.
- Let's just walk south.

00:41:58.073 --> 00:41:59.283
Because I haven't!

00:41:59.867 --> 00:42:01.201
Why are we stopped?

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:07.750
Why are we stopped?

00:42:10.711 --> 00:42:11.879
Just don't.

00:42:12.171 --> 00:42:15.215
I'm just asking
Why we stopped.

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:19.803
Weren't we going south?

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.889
We all seemed very
Happy with that.

00:42:22.222 --> 00:42:24.558
Why don't we carry on like that?

00:42:34.068 --> 00:42:34.860
What?

00:42:35.152 --> 00:42:37.196
There's all sorts of
Stuff down here!

00:42:37.446 --> 00:42:38.655
What kind of stuff?

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:40.574
Voodoo shit!

00:42:42.409 --> 00:42:43.660
What?

00:42:43.827 --> 00:42:46.830
- Hanging all over the place!
- No way...

00:42:48.665 --> 00:42:49.958
It's all over.

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:51.085
Holy shit...

00:42:53.253 --> 00:42:55.714
Come up quick! I need the CP!

00:42:55.923 --> 00:42:57.591
There's all sorts
Here, man!

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.928
This is fucking crazy shit.

00:43:04.264 --> 00:43:05.933
Please, I gotta film this!

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:07.351
Take the fucking camera.

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:12.398
What the fuck is this?

00:43:12.606 --> 00:43:13.857
I have no idea.

00:43:56.692 --> 00:44:00.362
Jesus Christ, that's fucking creepy.

00:44:04.324 --> 00:44:07.494
This is no redneck.
No redneck is this creative.

00:44:09.746 --> 00:44:10.789
Can we go now?

00:44:10.998 --> 00:44:12.416
Yeah, please.

00:44:13.166 --> 00:44:15.669
Okay, I got everything on video.

00:44:15.836 --> 00:44:18.589
Oh, Jesus Christ, I didn't
Even see these!

00:44:19.381 --> 00:44:22.092
Okay, Heather, you got
Enough, man. Let's go.

00:44:22.426 --> 00:44:25.846
- That's enough! Stop taping!
- That's enough!

00:44:26.096 --> 00:44:28.849
- Okay, we're going right now.
- Let's go!

00:44:29.099 --> 00:44:32.769
Okay, we're out of here.
I'm leaving.

00:44:33.979 --> 00:44:35.439
Come on, turn it off!

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:38.775
Help!

00:44:40.777 --> 00:44:42.779
Please help us!

00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:47.367
We won't get out of here like that.

00:44:47.701 --> 00:44:48.577
Fuck!

00:44:49.369 --> 00:44:50.662
Fuck!

00:44:51.371 --> 00:44:54.833
I think I can say
that we're now lost.

00:44:55.792 --> 00:44:57.294
I don't know what to do.

00:44:58.712 --> 00:45:00.881
We should all get
Inside the tent.

00:45:01.214 --> 00:45:02.132
All right.

00:45:02.466 --> 00:45:04.384
Let's not light a fire tonight.

00:45:04.885 --> 00:45:06.136
Yeah, that's my thinking.

00:45:06.303 --> 00:45:09.473
- That's a good idea.
- We didn't light one the first night.

00:45:09.681 --> 00:45:10.557
And nothing happened.

00:45:10.724 --> 00:45:13.727
We light fires, and they know.
No one was following us.

00:45:14.102 --> 00:45:15.562
We should turn that light off, too.

00:45:15.729 --> 00:45:16.813
All right.

00:45:17.064 --> 00:45:19.816
Seriously, anything
could attract them.

00:45:21.318 --> 00:45:22.653
Let's just go to sleep.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.251
Oh God.

00:45:42.839 --> 00:45:44.174
Put this out.

00:46:06.696 --> 00:46:09.866
Jesus Christ, little kids. Oh, God!

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.618
I'm gonna put my jeans on.

00:46:11.785 --> 00:46:14.621
Take the video camera.
No, the DAT.

00:46:15.288 --> 00:46:17.290
I'm gonna get this on video.

00:46:17.457 --> 00:46:19.126
Oh, dear God, dear God!

00:46:32.055 --> 00:46:33.557
Go, fucking go!

00:46:34.641 --> 00:46:35.475
Oh God!

00:46:36.726 --> 00:46:37.978
Oh God!

00:46:40.397 --> 00:46:41.398
Hurry up!

00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:44.484
I'm coming! My boots aren't laced!

00:46:45.569 --> 00:46:47.571
Oh my God, what the fuck is that?

00:46:48.488 --> 00:46:50.157
What the fuck is that?

00:46:57.581 --> 00:46:58.665
Oh, shit!

00:47:06.256 --> 00:47:08.508
Mike, where are you, man?

00:47:18.101 --> 00:47:19.603
Turn the lights off...

00:47:20.187 --> 00:47:22.606
...turn that light off.
turn it off, Josh.

00:47:25.275 --> 00:47:28.528
All lights off,
all lights off.

00:47:35.952 --> 00:47:37.203
I'm soaking.

00:47:37.287 --> 00:47:38.455
That's okay.

00:47:39.039 --> 00:47:40.290
What was that?

00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:43.293
What the fuck is going on?

00:47:49.215 --> 00:47:51.551
You hear that baby screaming?

00:47:51.885 --> 00:47:54.304
Shut the fuck up. There's
no fucking baby.

00:47:54.554 --> 00:47:57.474
- Yes there was.
- There was no fucking baby.

00:48:01.061 --> 00:48:03.313
I haven't heard anything
since we ran away...

00:48:06.149 --> 00:48:07.651
Oh my God, it's cold.

00:48:08.902 --> 00:48:10.654
We should be quiet, okay?

00:48:20.246 --> 00:48:22.916
I don't hear anything anymore.
Let's go back.

00:48:26.086 --> 00:48:27.837
How long have we been here?

00:48:28.088 --> 00:48:29.756
I don't know, man, an hour...?

00:48:31.925 --> 00:48:34.010
The sun's up. We're okay now.

00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:38.264
Let's just get back,
pack up, and go.

00:48:38.431 --> 00:48:39.683
Okay.

00:48:42.435 --> 00:48:44.187
What the fuck, man?

00:48:44.854 --> 00:48:46.356
Where's my pack?

00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:48.358
Right there. Where's mine?

00:48:48.858 --> 00:48:50.527
What the fuck, man?

00:48:58.118 --> 00:48:59.953
Why're they fucking
with us like this?

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:02.455
They just opened it up.

00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:04.624
They spilled all my water!

00:49:04.958 --> 00:49:06.459
Looks like slime, man.

00:49:07.377 --> 00:49:08.545
It's just water, man.

00:49:09.212 --> 00:49:11.548
It is slime. What the fuck is it?

00:49:11.965 --> 00:49:13.466
Let's get out of here.

00:49:13.633 --> 00:49:15.051
- Heather, turn that thing off!
- Let's go.

00:49:15.301 --> 00:49:16.136
Okay.

00:49:16.302 --> 00:49:18.304
I'm not interested
anymore! Let's go!

00:49:18.555 --> 00:49:19.389
I know.

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:20.807
So turn it off.

00:49:21.391 --> 00:49:23.977
Relax. Have we got everything here?

00:49:25.061 --> 00:49:27.063
- Like I give a shit.
- Whose bag was opened?

00:49:27.313 --> 00:49:28.481
It was mine!

00:49:31.734 --> 00:49:33.069
Why you?

00:49:33.403 --> 00:49:35.405
Are you not scared enough yet?

00:49:35.572 --> 00:49:36.322
But why you?

00:49:36.823 --> 00:49:38.658
Put it down. This is not funny.

00:49:38.825 --> 00:49:41.327
Am I laughing at all?

00:49:41.578 --> 00:49:44.747
No, but you're still doing
your documentary thing, man!

00:49:44.998 --> 00:49:46.416
Still your fucking documentary!

00:49:46.666 --> 00:49:49.419
- Don't touch it!
- Then turn the goddam thing off!

00:49:49.586 --> 00:49:52.255
If you bite me again,
I'll throw you in river.

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:55.758
- Don't touch my camera.
- Turn it off!

00:49:56.092 --> 00:49:56.926
I'm sorry.

00:49:57.093 --> 00:49:58.595
I didn't mean it, okay?

00:49:58.761 --> 00:49:59.679
You all right?

00:49:59.846 --> 00:50:01.431
Yeah. I wanna go home...

00:50:01.681 --> 00:50:03.516
...but I wanna get
what we can.

00:50:04.184 --> 00:50:05.185
What the fuck...?

00:50:07.437 --> 00:50:08.855
Is this possible?

00:50:09.772 --> 00:50:11.441
All right.

00:50:12.442 --> 00:50:13.443
Here I go.

00:50:13.776 --> 00:50:16.112
I hate crossing streams on logs.

00:50:16.863 --> 00:50:18.531
If I never cross another stream...

00:50:18.781 --> 00:50:21.534
...on a log, I'll die happy.

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:26.956
I see why you like the
video camera so much.

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:29.375
You do?

00:50:29.626 --> 00:50:31.377
It's not quite reality.

00:50:34.214 --> 00:50:36.049
Reality says we gotta move.

00:50:37.383 --> 00:50:40.470
But it's a totally filtered
reality, man.

00:50:41.971 --> 00:50:45.475
As if everything's
not quite the way it is.

00:50:48.811 --> 00:50:50.313
Just leave him alone awhile

00:50:50.563 --> 00:50:51.648
We need to go.

00:50:51.898 --> 00:50:53.316
Leave him for five minutes.

00:50:54.233 --> 00:50:57.070
Leave him alone. Five minutes.

00:50:57.487 --> 00:50:58.988
Come on, he's lost it.

00:51:00.239 --> 00:51:02.659
I know, but we've all
nearly lost it.

00:51:02.825 --> 00:51:05.828
I know, but we got
to look after each other.

00:51:06.162 --> 00:51:08.164
And we're not looking after him...

00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:10.333
...if we film him
while he's crying.

00:51:10.583 --> 00:51:11.334
I know.

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:12.835
I know you know.

00:51:13.002 --> 00:51:15.505
Let's try and keep our wits.

00:51:15.755 --> 00:51:17.090
But we have to go.

00:51:17.256 --> 00:51:19.592
Sure. Believe me, I know.

00:51:19.759 --> 00:51:21.511
It's hard to stay calm.

00:51:21.678 --> 00:51:23.763
- We need to get out.
- I know.

00:51:24.013 --> 00:51:25.431
You're not telling me
anything new,

00:51:26.265 --> 00:51:28.267
Just let him calm down.

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:29.852
Anybody got a cigarette?

00:51:30.019 --> 00:51:30.853
No, man.

00:51:31.104 --> 00:51:32.438
No, there's none left.

00:51:33.272 --> 00:51:35.191
Nobody has any cigarettes?

00:51:35.358 --> 00:51:36.442
We're out.

00:51:39.529 --> 00:51:41.280
Why the fuck...

00:51:41.614 --> 00:51:44.283
...was this blue jelly
shit on my shit?

00:51:44.534 --> 00:51:45.618
Let's go.

00:51:46.452 --> 00:51:47.537
Let's go.

00:51:48.204 --> 00:51:50.790
If we keep going south,
we'll get out.

00:51:51.874 --> 00:51:52.875
Please...

00:51:54.377 --> 00:51:57.046
I don't wanna camp
another fucking night.

00:51:57.213 --> 00:51:59.632
Josh, none of us do.

00:51:59.799 --> 00:52:00.717
I know you don't.

00:52:00.967 --> 00:52:04.220
Whoever it is, is gonna come
back, and that's a fact.

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:05.555
It's not a fact.

00:52:05.805 --> 00:52:08.725
It came three nights running,
and it's worse every night.

00:52:08.891 --> 00:52:11.561
Just what I need to
hear right now.

00:52:11.728 --> 00:52:15.231
I'm just trying to
rationally say that...

00:52:15.815 --> 00:52:19.902
...with our walking speed,
they might just go on forever...

00:52:20.737 --> 00:52:24.157
Not possible in this country.

00:52:24.907 --> 00:52:25.825
Why not?

00:52:25.992 --> 00:52:29.662
Because we've destroyed most
of our woods in America.

00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:33.166
- Let's just keep going.
- America, America...

00:52:33.499 --> 00:52:36.919
...God shed your grace on thee...

00:52:40.006 --> 00:52:44.010
...Once so proudly we hailed...

00:52:44.927 --> 00:52:48.264
...at twilight's last gleaming...

00:52:50.683 --> 00:52:52.351
That's the tree we crossed.

00:52:52.518 --> 00:52:54.604
That tree is down. Same one.

00:52:57.273 --> 00:52:58.691
Oh God!

00:52:59.525 --> 00:53:00.276
Oh no...

00:53:00.443 --> 00:53:03.196
You got to be kidding,
this is a joke!

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:06.782
It's not funny!

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:10.953
Mike, please stop...
please stop...

00:53:14.874 --> 00:53:16.375
Oh no!

00:53:17.126 --> 00:53:19.045
No, Mike, it's not the same log!

00:53:21.881 --> 00:53:23.799
- Same log!
- Look, it's not!

00:53:23.966 --> 00:53:25.801
Yes it is! Open your eyes!

00:53:26.052 --> 00:53:28.054
It's not the same log...

00:53:46.405 --> 00:53:47.907
It's the same log.

00:53:48.658 --> 00:53:51.077
Fuck you, God!!

00:53:51.661 --> 00:53:53.746
It's the same log.

00:54:01.003 --> 00:54:03.673
Okay, it's okay.

00:54:09.345 --> 00:54:11.597
Where do you wanna camp?

00:54:11.847 --> 00:54:14.433
Going south didn't work.
Tomorrow we go east.

00:54:14.684 --> 00:54:16.686
I don't know what to say, Josh.

00:54:17.937 --> 00:54:20.439
How the fuck did we wind
up in the same place?

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:24.694
We walked south
all fucking day!

00:54:24.944 --> 00:54:26.946
I don't know how we
ended up here!

00:54:33.869 --> 00:54:36.205
Do you expect me to do,
or say something?

00:54:45.464 --> 00:54:46.882
What do you wanna do?

00:54:53.305 --> 00:54:54.557
Josh?

00:54:59.395 --> 00:55:01.397
I wanna make movies, Heather.

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:05.818
Isn't that why we came?

00:55:07.987 --> 00:55:09.822
Let's make some movies.

00:55:10.156 --> 00:55:11.574
Fuck you.

00:55:14.326 --> 00:55:15.828
Fuck you.

00:55:15.995 --> 00:55:18.164
Let's not fight, please?

00:55:19.331 --> 00:55:22.084
...I can't take it.
I can't fight.

00:55:22.251 --> 00:55:26.088
We're screwed, and that's it.
Please stop fighting.

00:55:27.173 --> 00:55:28.758
I'll do the first watch.

00:55:30.843 --> 00:55:32.511
I got first watch.

00:55:40.686 --> 00:55:42.605
It's not the time or place, guys.

00:55:42.772 --> 00:55:44.607
We have things to prepare for.

00:55:44.774 --> 00:55:46.442
Okay, here's your motivation...

00:55:46.776 --> 00:55:50.029
...you're lost, you're angry and
no one's here to help you...

00:55:50.279 --> 00:55:53.616
...there's a fucking witch who
keeps leaving shit around...

00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:55.284
...no one can help you...

00:55:55.451 --> 00:55:57.953
...she left little trinkets, and
you fucking took one...

00:55:58.204 --> 00:56:00.706
...she's chasing us. And
no one can help you!

00:56:00.873 --> 00:56:02.708
We walked fifteen hours today...

00:56:02.875 --> 00:56:05.044
...and we ended up in the same place!

00:56:05.294 --> 00:56:08.714
There's no one to help you!
That's your motivation!

00:56:12.635 --> 00:56:14.053
Please stop.

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:17.640
Josh, quit it. She's had enough.

00:56:18.557 --> 00:56:20.809
You got her back. Good one.

00:56:20.976 --> 00:56:23.479
No, she's still making movies!

00:56:23.729 --> 00:56:25.648
- Please stop.
- Still making movies.

00:56:25.898 --> 00:56:28.734
It's all I have left, okay?
Just please stop.

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.989
Please stop yelling at me.

00:56:39.328 --> 00:56:41.830
I'm fucking tired of
crying all day.

00:56:42.665 --> 00:56:45.751
We gotta think like human beings.
We got things to do.

00:56:45.918 --> 00:56:48.587
We've gotta do shifts.
We got lots to do.

00:56:54.677 --> 00:56:57.096
You gonna write us a
happy ending, Heather?

00:57:06.105 --> 00:57:07.773
Come on, turn it off.

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:10.693
You're getting like she was.

00:57:16.115 --> 00:57:19.702
I don't know how you can
sew at this point, man,

00:57:19.868 --> 00:57:21.787
Well, I'm cold.

00:57:22.371 --> 00:57:24.290
- I know.
- I hear you.

00:57:24.623 --> 00:57:26.959
The smallest comforts
we can get are good.

00:57:27.209 --> 00:57:29.795
Doesn't it seem absurd,
though, at this point?

00:57:30.045 --> 00:57:31.130
Yes, it does.

00:57:31.297 --> 00:57:33.549
Lots of things seem absurd.

00:57:33.882 --> 00:57:37.386
Like sleeping where we were
last night is freaking...

00:57:37.553 --> 00:57:39.722
It's just fucking me up, period.

00:57:40.639 --> 00:57:43.976
Really fucking me up, man.

00:57:47.896 --> 00:57:50.983
- I'm sorry, man.
- Me too. It's all right.

00:57:51.316 --> 00:57:52.818
I'm sorry, Heather.

00:57:53.318 --> 00:57:54.570
It's all right.

00:57:55.070 --> 00:57:57.156
Who wants a cheeseburger?

00:57:57.823 --> 00:57:59.158
I do, I do...

00:58:00.075 --> 00:58:02.494
I got a cheeseburger in my pocket.

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:06.248
Do you? Can I have a
light to cut this?

00:58:06.999 --> 00:58:08.500
Know what I'd fucking love?

00:58:08.917 --> 00:58:09.835
What?

00:58:10.085 --> 00:58:11.420
Mashed potatoes.

00:58:12.588 --> 00:58:13.756
Me too.

00:58:16.008 --> 00:58:18.927
My mom's mashed potatoes.

00:58:23.098 --> 00:58:25.517
You'll have them again very soon.

00:58:27.019 --> 00:58:30.189
Mashed potatoes
and a piece of ass.

00:58:31.857 --> 00:58:32.941
Josh?

00:58:36.779 --> 00:58:39.448
Fuck, we never go out of earshot!

00:58:40.699 --> 00:58:42.451
Come on, calm down.

00:58:43.952 --> 00:58:45.370
How can I?

00:58:55.047 --> 00:58:56.548
He's probably at the river.

00:58:56.715 --> 00:58:59.051
If he was there,
he could hear me.

00:59:03.972 --> 00:59:05.641
Wait for him to respond.

00:59:06.391 --> 00:59:08.477
Remember what he said yesterday?

00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:09.895
What?

00:59:11.647 --> 00:59:14.900
About the shit on his bag.

00:59:18.987 --> 00:59:22.741
Let's go. We've gotta find
him. Come on.

00:59:22.991 --> 00:59:26.745
If we can't even find the car,
how are we gonna find Josh?

00:59:26.995 --> 00:59:27.996
Come on.

00:59:28.247 --> 00:59:29.831
No, I'm fine.

00:59:30.916 --> 00:59:32.834
Come on, come on, relax.

00:59:33.001 --> 00:59:35.587
All right, let's take
down the tent...

00:59:36.088 --> 00:59:37.506
...and when he's back, we'll go.

00:59:37.839 --> 00:59:39.591
I'm losing my mind, Mike.

00:59:40.175 --> 00:59:41.510
Josh hasn't come back.

00:59:41.677 --> 00:59:42.427
Heather?

00:59:43.428 --> 00:59:44.930
I'm here, Mike.

00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:51.019
I don't know if Josh ran off.

00:59:52.521 --> 00:59:54.022
All his shit's here.

00:59:55.941 --> 00:59:57.192
I've got the camera...

00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.862
...I don't know how I'm
gonna hike with the camera.

01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:03.448
Sure you wanna take it?

01:00:03.615 --> 01:00:04.783
We have to take the camera.

01:00:06.618 --> 01:00:08.620
How do you feel about east?

01:00:10.622 --> 01:00:12.207
How do you feel about east?

01:00:14.376 --> 01:00:16.211
Well, south didn't work.

01:00:18.046 --> 01:00:21.717
Which witch was worse, the one
from the east or from the south?

01:00:23.719 --> 01:00:26.305
The witch of the
west was the bad one.

01:00:26.888 --> 01:00:28.140
Let's go east.

01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:33.061
What the hell is that?

01:00:34.646 --> 01:00:35.564
Josh?

01:00:40.819 --> 01:00:42.571
We'll have to put up the tent.

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.501
I'd like a meatball.

01:00:56.752 --> 01:00:58.170
Just one meatball?

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.505
And a big glass of red wine.

01:01:00.672 --> 01:01:03.759
Yeah, I would like a whole
fucking bottle of Bordeaux.

01:01:04.176 --> 01:01:05.761
And a pack of smokes.

01:01:05.927 --> 01:01:09.681
That'd be good.
and a long, hot bath.

01:01:09.848 --> 01:01:11.349
And a big pumpkin pie.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.351
A pumpkin pie with ice cream?

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:17.105
Warm with milky ice cream?

01:01:17.272 --> 01:01:18.523
Yeah, sounds good.

01:01:19.024 --> 01:01:21.359
What do you like
to do on a Sunday?

01:01:23.695 --> 01:01:26.615
I used to like to drive to the
woods and go hiking.

01:01:30.452 --> 01:01:32.204
But I think that might change now.

01:01:32.954 --> 01:01:34.539
I think you could scratch that.

01:01:49.221 --> 01:01:50.722
Should we open the door?

01:01:52.057 --> 01:01:53.558
Is it a trick?

01:02:03.235 --> 01:02:04.236
Josh!

01:02:06.154 --> 01:02:07.239
Josh!

01:02:19.501 --> 01:02:21.169
Where's it coming from?

01:02:35.517 --> 01:02:38.436
Josh, where are you?
Tell me where you are!

01:02:42.274 --> 01:02:45.193
Oh my God, no.

01:02:51.533 --> 01:02:53.702
Do you think that's them again?

01:03:00.709 --> 01:03:01.710
Is it over here?

01:03:01.876 --> 01:03:03.628
No, it's over here.

01:03:14.306 --> 01:03:15.557
We'll look for him.

01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:31.906
I don't know if it's really him.

01:03:44.336 --> 01:03:46.421
I don't even know where to look.

01:03:51.343 --> 01:03:53.845
Tell me where you are, Josh!

01:03:57.015 --> 01:03:57.849
Mike?

01:03:58.099 --> 01:04:00.268
- What?
- Please don't fall asleep.

01:04:00.435 --> 01:04:01.853
I can't fall asleep.

01:04:05.774 --> 01:04:09.194
Whatever it is, it
knows Josh has gone.

01:04:14.699 --> 01:04:17.702
If that was Josh, he would've
said where he was.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.459
Whatever it was, it
sounded like Josh.

01:04:26.628 --> 01:04:27.545
See?

01:04:28.713 --> 01:04:31.466
I just want to show you
that Mike's here.

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:33.551
There. He's sleeping.

01:04:41.559 --> 01:04:42.727
Oh, shit.

01:04:46.564 --> 01:04:47.982
What the hell is that?

01:04:51.736 --> 01:04:53.154
- Mike.
- What?

01:04:55.073 --> 01:04:56.741
There's something out here.

01:05:03.331 --> 01:05:06.417
Okay,

01:05:07.836 --> 01:05:10.088
I'm gonna move it
from in front of the tent.

01:05:10.338 --> 01:05:12.257
- Get rid of it.
- Okay.

01:05:14.425 --> 01:05:17.679
I'm taking it away
from the tent.

01:05:18.596 --> 01:05:20.765
I'm just throwing it.

01:05:26.437 --> 01:05:29.190
We'll just keep walking, okay.

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.525
Okay.

01:05:34.362 --> 01:05:38.366
I found some cigarettes
at the bottom of my pack...

01:05:38.533 --> 01:05:41.202
...so if we're smoking,
we're still alive.

01:06:31.669 --> 01:06:33.254
It's all full of blood.

01:07:13.378 --> 01:07:16.881
Shit, shit, shit!

01:07:23.221 --> 01:07:24.555
Oh my God!

01:07:38.236 --> 01:07:39.570
Okay, see...?

01:07:40.988 --> 01:07:41.906
Yeah?

01:07:43.741 --> 01:07:44.659
What are you doing?

01:07:44.826 --> 01:07:46.911
Just washing my hands!

01:07:47.161 --> 01:07:47.829
What?

01:07:47.995 --> 01:07:49.580
Just washing my hands!

01:07:50.498 --> 01:07:51.499
I'm fine.

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:53.835
I'm gonna put my gloves on.

01:08:03.594 --> 01:08:04.595
You all right?

01:08:04.762 --> 01:08:08.599
I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:08:12.103 --> 01:08:13.187
You need help?

01:08:13.354 --> 01:08:15.523
No, I don't need any help.

01:08:16.691 --> 01:08:17.775
I'm okay.

01:08:17.942 --> 01:08:18.609
What happened?

01:08:18.776 --> 01:08:22.113
Nothing. I'm just very
hungry and very tired...

01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:24.866
...and very scared, and I just
wanna go home, okay?

01:08:25.032 --> 01:08:25.783
Okay.

01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:27.952
But I'm fine, and we're okay.

01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:37.378
Ow! My hair's caught.

01:08:40.214 --> 01:08:42.967
Thank you, thank you.

01:08:45.219 --> 01:08:48.639
Okay, okay.

01:09:32.183 --> 01:09:34.852
Two thousand one
hundred thirty games...

01:09:35.603 --> 01:09:38.189
...one more season and
Cal Ripken is king!

01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:44.695
And I won't see it...

01:09:45.863 --> 01:09:47.948
...because I'll be in the woods.

01:10:03.297 --> 01:10:06.634
Tell me you're not
eating a dry leaf.

01:10:17.728 --> 01:10:19.397
I just want to apologize...

01:10:20.981 --> 01:10:22.733
...to Mike's mom...

01:10:23.818 --> 01:10:25.486
...and Josh's mom...

01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:28.155
...and my mom...

01:10:31.242 --> 01:10:33.661
...and I'm sorry to everyone...

01:10:35.996 --> 01:10:37.998
...I was very nave.

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:46.173
I am so, so, sorry...

01:10:47.091 --> 01:10:49.093
...for everything that's happened...

01:10:50.678 --> 01:10:53.347
...because in spite of
what Mike says now...

01:10:53.514 --> 01:10:54.765
...it was my fault...

01:10:56.434 --> 01:10:58.185
...because it was my project...

01:10:59.186 --> 01:11:00.855
...and I insisted...

01:11:02.523 --> 01:11:04.358
...insisted on everything.

01:11:05.276 --> 01:11:08.112
I insisted we weren't lost...

01:11:09.447 --> 01:11:12.199
...I insisted we keep going...

01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:15.619
...I insisted we walk south.

01:11:17.121 --> 01:11:19.957
Everything had
to be my way.

01:11:20.291 --> 01:11:22.459
And this is how we've ended up.

01:11:23.794 --> 01:11:26.922
And it's all because of me
that we're here now...

01:11:27.298 --> 01:11:29.633
...hungry and cold...

01:11:31.969 --> 01:11:33.679
...and hunted.

01:11:38.851 --> 01:11:40.519
I love you, mom...

01:11:41.729 --> 01:11:42.980
...dad...

01:11:45.816 --> 01:11:47.651
...I am so sorry.

01:11:53.824 --> 01:11:55.409
...what was that?

01:12:08.172 --> 01:12:10.507
I'm scared to close my eyes...

01:12:11.425 --> 01:12:13.344
...and scared to open them.

01:12:20.601 --> 01:12:22.019
Oh God...

01:12:22.686 --> 01:12:24.438
...we're gonna die here.

01:12:28.859 --> 01:12:31.111
- You got it?
- You ready?

01:12:32.947 --> 01:12:34.615
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.211
You ready?

01:12:47.378 --> 01:12:49.338
Here, take this light.

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:54.009
That can't be him.

01:13:34.258 --> 01:13:36.677
Holy shit, it's a house.

01:13:38.595 --> 01:13:41.765
- Watch your step.
- Holy shit, Holy shit...

01:14:02.953 --> 01:14:03.787
Josh?

01:14:18.135 --> 01:14:20.971
Mike. Mike.

01:14:22.556 --> 01:14:23.557
Come on.

01:14:24.641 --> 01:14:26.268
Mike, where the fuck are you?

01:14:26.477 --> 01:14:28.395
Come on, I'm in the house!

01:14:28.896 --> 01:14:31.482
Mike, don't go in there, please!

01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:53.837
Mike, please!
Mike, where are you?

01:14:54.004 --> 01:14:55.088
I'm right here!

01:15:02.262 --> 01:15:03.430
Where is he?

01:15:03.764 --> 01:15:05.515
Mike, please don't.

01:15:14.733 --> 01:15:16.026
Is he in here?

01:15:16.193 --> 01:15:17.110
No.

01:15:31.625 --> 01:15:32.876
Oh, Jesus.

01:15:33.126 --> 01:15:34.294
Where is he?

01:15:35.712 --> 01:15:37.381
Are you gonna go upstairs?

01:15:39.299 --> 01:15:41.468
I hear him. I hear him.

01:15:41.969 --> 01:15:43.804
I hear you. Josh!

01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:53.981
I'm going upstairs.

01:15:57.484 --> 01:16:00.612
Oh, God, oh.

01:16:05.492 --> 01:16:06.368
Hear that?

01:16:08.453 --> 01:16:09.538
Where is he?

01:16:09.997 --> 01:16:11.581
Where are you?

01:16:13.834 --> 01:16:15.001
Come on!

01:16:19.339 --> 01:16:20.841
I'm getting downstairs.

01:16:22.050 --> 01:16:24.594
Come on, I hear him, downstairs!

01:16:25.846 --> 01:16:26.513
Mike!

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:27.597
Come on!

01:16:27.848 --> 01:16:28.515
Mike!

01:16:28.724 --> 01:16:29.516
Josh!

01:16:29.766 --> 01:16:31.017
Wait!

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.526
Josh, is that you down there?
