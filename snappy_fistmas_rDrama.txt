Hello Dahncer_the_reindeer, or should I say rapedeer? 8 letters, fitting huh. If this life were perfect you'd have known nothing but milk and cookies since you left your birthers cunt. However, it's not- that's where I come in.

You have no say anymore, no freedom, no volition- I am Santa. You now worship my Christmas tree. You can call me Nicholas. A saint? No, but I come with more conviction.

Dahncer_the_reindeer you are my r*pe sleigh-ve now. And that's your greatest achievement- all you've ever amounted to, tugging and pulling my sleigh as we break the space time continuum together you complete fricking slut. I'll find you.

Wife is J-pilled, parents are open and never opposing to my distain for jews and my love of history and the NatSoc movement. Sister in law is bleeding heart liberal, but not extreme leftist still shuts down and won't talk when cornered in an argument against her beliefs.

Anyways, today somehow jews came up and WWII which got the comment “Hitler was the most evil man” my wife overhears, rolls her eyes, gets ready for the speech. I casually explain to my sister in law what the jews did to German people before WWII and why Hitler gained power, what he did for Germany, and how the Holocaust doesn't make sense and numbers don't add up.

I talked for an hour straight as she butted in with questions but sat quietly listening as you could see her face deeply question everything she's been told. After an hour she didn't freak out or shut down, just politely said “that's all I can handle on Christmas” and when we hugged goodbye she whispered “nazi” as I whispered “sieg heil” at the same time to each other and everyone burst out laughing.

That would have NEVER happened before. The fact it did means she is becoming much more comfortable with my views which I consider huge win.

Merry Christmas!
